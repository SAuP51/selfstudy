Abstract

Often analysts will observe that they do not have enough time to use Structured Analytic Techniques. When presented with this challenge by analysts in the UK Cabinet Office, the author came up with the following response: Develop these five habits when you have time so that when time is short you have developed a capacity to use them instinctively. This article describes the Five Habits of the Master Thinker in detail, reviews how they were selected, and explores how they can most easily be inculcated into how an analyst processes information.

### 01. Introduction

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the erroneous 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction revealed a fundamental need within the United States Intelligence Community (IC) to reassess how it went about doing analysis.1 The sharpest criticism came from the Congressional Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction that documented a failure to challenge analytic mindsets, examine key assumptions, consider alternative hypotheses, and detect deceptive reporting. Such criticisms were not new to the IC.

- In the 1980s, Jack Davis began writing about the need for "alternative analysis" which he described as the evaluation of alternative explanations or hypotheses, better understanding of other cultures, and analyzing events from the perspective of the adversary.

- In the 1990s, CIA began teaching the Alternative Analysis Workshop to introduce analysts to a handful of techniques designed to instill more rigor in their analysis.

- In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the focus on alternative analysis was broadened to encompass a new approach to analytic tradecraft using Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs).

This article will review the basics of these Structured Analytic Techniques, how they came to be, and their role in the analytic process. With the practice of the core techniques presented, analysts can develop five mental habits that enable proficient and transparent assessment even when there is not enough time to go through a lengthy checklist. Ultimately, the implementation of SATs and the adoption of the five habits will lead to better analysis in a shorter period of time.

2001 年 9 月 11 日的恐怖袭击和 2002 年关于伊拉克大规模杀伤性武器的错误国家情报估计，揭示了美国情报界（IC）重新评估其分析方法的迫切需求。国会大规模杀伤性武器委员会的批评最为尖锐，记录了在挑战分析思维、检查关键假设、考虑替代假设和检测欺骗性报告方面的失败。这些批评对情报界来说并不新鲜。

- 在 20 世纪 80 年代，Jack Davis 开始撰写关于「替代分析」需求的文章，他描述了评估替代解释或假设、更好地理解其他文化以及从对手角度分析事件的重要性。

- 在 20 世纪 90 年代，CIA 开始教授替代分析研讨会，向分析师介绍了一些技术，旨在使他们的分析更加严谨。

- 在 9/11 袭击事件后，替代分析的重点被扩大到包括使用结构化分析技术（SATs）进行分析的新方法。

本文将介绍结构化分析技术（SAT）的基础知识、发展历程及其在分析过程中的作用。掌握这些核心技术后，分析师可以培养五种思维习惯，即使在时间紧迫的情况下也能进行高效、透明的评估。最终，应用 SAT 和养成这些习惯将使分析变得更加迅速和准确。

### 02. The Emergence of Structured Analytic Techniques

Structured analysis employs a variety of techniques by which internal thought processes are externalized in a systematic and transparent manner so that they can be shared, built on, and easily critiqued by others. Each technique leaves a trail that other analysts, managers, and customers can follow to see the basis for an analytic judgment. They have been used by IC methodologists and by analysts in selected specialties for many years, but the general use of these techniques by the average analyst is relatively new. The driving forces behind increasing development and use of these techniques are:

- Prominent intelligence failures that have prompted reexamination of how intelligence analysis is generated.

- An increased appreciation of cognitive limitations and pitfalls that make intelligence analysis so difficult.

- Pressure to adopt more collaborative work processes.

- The desire by policymakers who receive analysis that it be more transparent as to how the conclusions were reached.

Structured Analytic Techniques provide a first line of defense against common analytic pitfalls as described in Richards J. Heuer, Jr.'s book, Psychology of Intelligence Analysis.2 They help analysts mitigate the proven cognitive limitations, side-step some of the known analytic pitfalls, and explicitly confront the problems associated with unquestioned mental models or mindsets. 3 There is, of course, no formula that exists for always getting it right, but the use of structured techniques can reduce the frequency and severity of error.

The step-by-step process of Structured Analytic Techniques organizes the interaction among analysts in a small analytic group or team in a way that helps to avoid the multiple pitfalls and pathologies that often degrade group or team performance. They are ideal for fostering collaboration among analysts with different areas of expertise and different organizational perspectives.

结构化分析技术的兴起

结构化分析使用多种方法，将内部思维过程以系统、透明的方式展现出来，便于分享、构建和批评。这些技术会留下路径，其他分析师、管理者和客户可以沿着这条路径查看分析判断的依据。多年来，这些技术被情报机构的方法学家和某些专业分析师使用，但普通分析师的应用相对较新。推动这些技术发展的因素包括：

- 显著的情报失败促使重新审视情报分析的方法。

- 对认知局限性和陷阱的认识增加，使情报分析变得更加复杂。

- 采用更具协作性的工作流程的压力。

- 政策制定者希望分析过程更加透明。

结构化分析技术是防御常见分析陷阱的第一道防线，这在 Richards J. Heuer, Jr. 的《情报分析心理学》一书中有详细描述。它们帮助分析师克服已知的认知局限，避开一些常见的分析陷阱，并直面那些不加质疑的心智模型或思维定势带来的问题。虽然没有一种方法能保证永远正确，但使用结构化技术可以减少错误的发生频率和严重程度。

结构化分析技术通过逐步的方法组织了小型分析组或团队中分析师之间的互动，有助于避免那些通常会削弱团队绩效的陷阱和问题。它们非常适合促进不同专业领域和不同组织背景的分析师之间的合作。

### 03. The Role of SATs in the Analytic Process

Intelligence analysts employ a range of methods to deal with an ever growing list of topics. Analytic techniques can be grouped into four broad categories based on the nature of the analytic methods used and the type of data that are available (see Figure 1).4 Although each method is distinct, the borders between them can be blurry.

- Unaided expert judgment often referred to as Traditional Analysis:5 This is the intuitive way most intelligence analysis is done. It includes evidentiary reasoning, most of what is generally considered critical thinking, historical method, case study method, and reasoning by analogy.

- Structured analysis: Structured techniques externalize the analyst's thinking in a manner that makes it visible to all, thereby enabling it to be reviewed and critiqued piece by piece, or step by step, by the author and by other knowledgeable analysts. Structured analysis is believed to mitigate the adverse impact on analysis of known cognitive limitations and pitfalls.

- Quasi-quantitative analysis: Analysts often lack the empirical data needed to analyze an intelligence problem and must substitute expert-generated data. This category includes methods such as Bayesian inference, dynamic modeling, and simulation.

- Empirical analysis: Sufficient empirical data must be available to allow quantitative analysis. Two examples include econometric modeling and data that is collected by sensors to analyze types of weapons systems.

Techniques from two or more of these categories will often be used in a single analytic project. For example, a structured analysis tool such as Structured Brainstorming might identify variables to be included in a dynamic model that uses expert-generated data to quantify these variables. Similarly, analysis of a military threat might combine the use of structured analytic techniques to assess motive or intent with a quantitative analysis of capabilities.

He recognizes that there is a clear need for the Intelligence Community to conduct systematic research on such benefits believed to be gained through the use of structured analytic techniques.

[5] The author and Richards J. Heuer, Jr. had difficulty selecting the name for this category. The term "traditional analysis" does not describe the procedural difference between this and the other categories. "Intuitive analysis" was rejected because the definition of intuition implies "without evident rational thought and inference." That certainly does not apply to the way conscious, deliberative analysis is conducted. Expert practitioners of traditional analysis do a great deal of systematic reasoning. "Expert judgment" is a good term for traditional analysis, but it does not distinguish traditional analysis from structured analysis, because structured analysis also relies on expert judgment. The difference is that with structured analysis the reasoning process is externalized more or less in real time, as the reasoning is being conducted. This externalization and systematic procedure is believed to aid the reasoning process and, especially, to help in collaboration with other analysts. That is the basis for the calling the more traditional approach to analysis "unaided" expert judgment.

结构化分析技术在分析过程中的作用

情报分析师使用多种方法来应对不断增长的主题。根据分析方法的性质和可用数据的类型，这些方法可以分为四大类（见图 1）。尽管每种方法都有其独特性，但它们之间的界限可能并不明确。

- 无辅助的专家判断，通常称为传统分析：这是一种大多数情报分析直觉进行的方式。包括证据推理、批判性思维、历史方法、案例研究方法和类比推理。

- 结构化分析：结构化技术将分析师的思维外化，使其对所有人可见，从而能够逐步地被作者和其他有经验的分析师审查和批评。结构化分析被认为可以减轻已知的认知局限和陷阱对分析的负面影响。

- 准定量分析方法：分析师往往缺乏分析情报问题所需的实证数据，因此必须使用专家生成的数据。此类方法包括贝叶斯推理、动态建模和模拟。

- 实证分析方法：需要有足够的实证数据才能进行定量分析。例如，计量经济模型和通过传感器收集的数据可以用来分析武器系统的类型。

在一个分析项目中，通常会结合使用多个类别的技术。例如，结构化分析工具如结构化头脑风暴可以识别出需要在动态模型中量化的变量，而这些变量的数据由专家生成。同样，军事威胁的分析可能会结合使用结构化分析技术来评估动机或意图，并对能力进行定量分析。

[5] 作者与 Richards J. Heuer, Jr. 在为这个类别命名时遇到了困难。「传统分析」一词并不能准确描述它与其他类别的程序差异。「直觉分析」被否决了，因为直觉的定义是「没有明显的理性思考和推理」。这显然不适用于有意识的、深思熟虑的分析。传统分析的专家会进行大量的系统推理。「专家判断」是描述传统分析的一个好词，但它无法将传统分析与结构化分析区分开，因为结构化分析也依赖于专家判断。区别在于，结构化分析的推理过程在进行时会或多或少地被外在化。这种外在化和系统化过程被认为有助于推理，尤其是有助于与其他分析师的协作。这就是为什么称更传统的分析方法为「无辅助」专家判断。

### 04. No Time for Structured Analytic Techniques?

The most common criticism of SATs is "I do not have enough time to use them." The experience of most analysts and particularly managers of analysts is that this criticism is not justified. In fact, if an analyst stops to consider how much time it takes to research an issue, draft an analysis, coordinate the analysis, and walk the paper through the editing process, he or she will usually discover that the use of structured techniques almost always speeds the process.

- Many of the techniques such as a Key Assumptions Check or Indicators Validation take little time, while substantially improving the rigor of the analysis.

- Some take a little more time to learn, but once learned, their use often saves the analyst considerable time over the long run. Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) and Red Hat Analysis provide good examples of this phenomenon.

- Several techniques such as the Getting Started Checklist, the Customer Checklist, or Issue Redefinition force the analyst to stop and reflect on how to be more efficient over time.

- Premortem Analysis and the Structured Self-Critique usually take more time but offer major awards should the analysis turn out to be incorrect and a post-mortem is initiated to determine why the conclusions or the recommendations were off track.

Structured techniques can also save time because they usually aid group processes and help build consensus in the early stages of framing a paper, thus avoiding major coordination battles later in the process. They make the reasoning behind the analysis more transparent, reducing the potential for misunderstanding.6

Another often heard—but incorrect—statement is that the intelligence article is too short, perhaps only a few paragraphs long, to merit the use of SATs. The best retort to this claim is to ask: "Are you saying you don't have enough time to do good analysis?" SATs infuse necessary rigor and structure into the analytic process and analysis that lacks such structure or the application of the scientific method is much more likely to be proven wrong over time.

没有时间进行结构化分析技术？

对 SATs 的最常见批评是「我没有足够的时间使用它们」。但大多数分析师，尤其是管理分析师的人，认为这种批评是不合理的。事实上，如果分析师仔细考虑一下研究一个问题、撰写分析报告、协调分析和编辑过程所需的时间，就会发现使用结构化技术实际上能加快整个过程。

- 许多技术，如关键假设检查和指标验证，花费的时间很少，却能显著提高分析的严谨性。

- 有些技术可能需要一些时间来学习，但一旦掌握，它们通常能在长期内为分析师节省大量时间。竞争假设分析（ACH）和红帽分析就是很好的例子。

- 一些技术，如入门清单、客户清单和问题重新定义，迫使分析师停下来反思如何随着时间的推移变得更高效。

- 预演分析和结构化自我批评通常需要更多时间，但如果分析结果出错并启动事后分析，这些技术可以提供重要的帮助，找出结论或建议偏离轨道的原因。

结构化技术还能节省时间，因为它们通常有助于团队合作，并在早期阶段建立共识，从而避免后期的重大协调问题。它们使分析过程中的推理更加透明，减少了误解的可能性。

另一个常见但错误的说法是，情报文章太短，可能只有几个段落，所以不值得使用 SATs。对此最好的回应是问：「你是说没有时间进行高质量的分析吗？」SATs 为分析过程注入了必要的严谨性和结构，而缺乏这些结构或科学方法的分析，随着时间的推移，更可能被证明是错误的。

### 05. When You Really Don't Have Enough Time

When working on quick turn-around items such as a current intelligence brief or an intelligence assessment on a fast-breaking topic that must be produced the same day, a credible argument can be made that it is not possible to take time out to use structured analytic techniques. When deadlines are short, it gathering the right people in a small group to employ the technique can prove impossible. The second problem may soon be overcome, however, with the introduction of new collaborative computer platforms, particularly those that are avatar-based and allow participants to work synchronously or asynchronously to brainstorm on virtual whiteboards, share their desktops, and draft joint papers.

The best response to this valid observation is to encourage analysts to practice using the core techniques when deadlines are less pressing. In so doing, they engrain new habits of thinking critically in their minds. If they, and their colleagues, practice how to apply the concepts embedded in the structured techniques when they have time, they will be more capable of applying these critical thinking skills instinctively when under pressure. The five core habits of a master thinker are described in Figure 2.

[6] See Richards J. Heuer, Jr. and Randolph H. Pherson, Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis, (Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2011) for definitions of each of these techniques, when to use them, step-by-step instructions on how to use them, and how they add value to the analytic process.

Figure 2: The Five Habits of the Master Thinker

A good analytic thinker who has mastered the core structured analytic techniques will instinctively:

1. Know when to challenge key assumptions—usually far more often than you think!

2. Consider alternative explanations or hypotheses for all events—including the null hypothesis and the deception hypothesis when applicable.

3. Look for inconsistent data that provides sufficient justification to quickly discard a candidate hypothesis.

4. Focus on the key drivers that best explain what has occurred or what is about to happen.

5. Anticipate the customers' needs and understand the overarching context within which the analysis is being done.

Habit 1: Challenge Key Assumptions

Because recognizing and challenging one's own assumptions is so difficult, analysts—and their managers—should strive to create an environment wherein assumptions are constantly being challenged on a daily basis. In a healthy work environment, challenging assumptions should be commonplace, ranging from "Why do you assume we all want pepperoni pizza?" to "Won't increased oil prices force them to reconsider their export strategy?" If you expect your colleagues to challenge your assumptions on a regular basis, you will become more sensitive to when you actually are making assumptions, and you will increasingly ask yourself if they are well-founded. If time allows, you should record your assumptions on a whiteboard or a piece of paper for review at a later date. Writing down the assumptions also greatly facilitates the process of examining them critically. Particular attention should be paid to assumptions that are assessed as Unsupported because these often are key uncertainties that need to be researched or for which collection requirements need to be written.

Habit 2: Consider Alternative Explanations

When confronted with a new development, the first instinct of a good analyst is to develop a hypothesis to explain what has occurred based on the available evidence and logic. A master analyst goes one step further and immediately asks whether any alternative explanations should also be considered. While at first glance these alternatives may appear much less likely, over time as new evidence surfaces they may evolve into the lead hypothesis. Analysts who do not generate a set of alternative explanations at the start and lock on to a preferred explanation will often fall into the trap of confirmation bias—focusing on the data that is consistent with their explanation and ignoring or rejecting other data that is inconsistent.

If envisioning an alternative explanation is difficult, then a master analyst will establish a null hypothesis, basically establishing in his or her own mind two hypotheses: X and Not X. The Not X hypothesis then becomes a bin in which to put what appears to be anomalous or outlier data that may at a later date might prove far more diagnostic. In some cases, consideration should also be given to establishing a deception hypothesis. This is particularly valuable when there are questions about the reliability of the data or major information gaps exist.

Habit 3: Look for Inconsistent Data

The habit of looking for inconsistent data is probably the hardest habit to master of the five, but it is the one that can reap the most benefits in terms of time saved when conducting an investigation or researching an issue. The best way to train your brain to look for inconsistent data is to conduct a series of ACH exercises. Such practice helps the analyst learn how to more readily identify what constitutes compelling contrary evidence. A master analyst will have already generated a set of comprehensive and mutually exclusive hypotheses. If he or she encounters an item of data that is inconsistent with one of the hypotheses in a compelling fashion (for example, a solid alibi), then that hypothesis can be quickly discarded, saving the analyst time by redirecting his or her attention to more likely solutions.

Habit 4: Identify Key Drivers

Asking at the outset what key drivers best explain what has occurred or will foretell what is about to happen constitutes the fourth of the five habits of the master thinker. If the key drivers can be identified, the chances of surprise will be significantly decreased. A practiced analyst should know how to vary the weights of these key drivers (either instinctively or by using such techniques as Multiple Scenarios Generation or Quadrant CrunchingTM) to generate a set of credible alternative scenarios that capture the range of possible outcomes. A master thinker will take this one step further, ensuring that he has generated a set of outcomes that represent both risks and opportunities for the policymaker. Moreover, a master thinker will develop a list of indicators that satisfy the five characteristics of a good indicator: Observable and Collectible, Valid, Reliable, Stable, and Unique. Uniqueness is often the most difficult criterion to satisfy and is best tested by using the Indicators ValidatorTM or other validation system.7

Habit 5: Understand the Context

Analysts often get so engaged in collecting and sorting data that they will miss the forest for the trees. Learning to stop and reflect on the overarching context for the analysis is the last, and one of the most critical, of the five habits. Most analysis is done under considerable time pressure and the tendency is to plunge in as soon as a task is assigned. If the analyst does not take time to reflect on what the customer is really seeking, the resulting analysis could prove inadequate and much of the research done a waste of time. You are better off learning how to "think above your pay grade" at the start by putting yourself in the shoes of management or the individual requesting the analysis. Ask yourself: "What do they need from me?" "How can I help them frame the issue?" and "Do I need to place their question in a broader context?" Failing to do this at the outset can easily result in the analyst going down blind alleys or having to reconceptualize an entire paper if a key assumption is found to be incorrect during coordination or editing.

Freeware and proprietary software has been developed to help the analyst learn many of these habits and to perform the analysis with rigor and more quickly. The Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) developed a freeware version of Analysis of Competing Hypothesis under the guidance of Richards J. Heuer and the author.8

Globalytica, LLC offers a collaborative, web-based version of ACH called Te@mACHTM for a modest fee. The software is one of three techniques comprising TH!NK SuiteTM which also includes the Multiple Hypotheses GeneratorTM and the Indicators ValidatorTM. Globalytica is also developing two other tools, the Te@m Assumptions CheckTM and Quadrant CrunchingTM, that will guide analysts through the key assumptions process and help them orchestrate the generation of alternative scenarios.9

当你真的没有足够的时间

在处理快速周转的任务时，比如当天需要完成的情报简报或紧急情报评估，确实有理由认为没有时间使用结构化分析技术。当截止日期很紧时，召集合适的人进行小组分析可能确实不现实。然而，随着新型协作计算平台的引入，特别是那些基于虚拟头像，允许参与者在虚拟白板上同步或异步进行头脑风暴、共享桌面和共同撰写文件的平台，这个问题可能很快得到解决。




对此合理意见的最佳回应是，鼓励分析师在时间宽裕时多练习核心技术。这样，他们可以在日常工作中养成新的批判性思维习惯。如果他们和同事在有时间时练习如何应用这些结构化技术的概念，那么在紧急情况下，他们也能更加自然而然地运用这些技能。图 2 描述了一位优秀分析师的五个核心习惯。

图 2：大师级思维的五个习惯一个掌握了核心结构化分析技术的优秀分析思维者通常会：

1. 经常质疑关键假设，比你想象的频繁得多。

2. 考虑所有事件的替代解释或假设，包括零假设和欺骗假设（如果适用）。

3. 寻找不一致的数据，以便迅速排除一个候选假设。

4. 关注最能解释已发生或即将发生事件的关键驱动因素。

5. 预见客户的需求，理解分析的总体背景。

习惯 1：挑战关键假设

因为识别和挑战自己的假设非常困难，分析师及其经理应该努力创造一个环境，让假设每天都能被挑战。在一个健康的工作环境中，挑战假设应该是一种常见的行为，从「为什么你认为我们都想吃意大利辣香肠披萨？」到「油价上涨是否会迫使他们重新考虑出口策略？」如果你期望同事们经常挑战你的假设，你会更敏锐地意识到自己何时在做假设，并且会越来越多地问自己这些假设是否有依据。如果时间允许，你应该把假设记录在白板或纸上，以便日后审查。写下假设也能大大促进对这些假设的批判性审查。特别要注意那些被评估为不支持的假设，因为这些往往是需要进一步研究的关键不确定性，或者需要编写数据收集需求。

习惯 2：考虑替代解释当面对新的情况时，一个优秀的分析师会首先根据现有证据和逻辑提出一个解释。而一个资深分析师会更进一步，立即考虑是否有其他替代解释。虽然这些替代解释乍看之下似乎不太可能，但随着时间推移和新证据的出现，它们可能会变成主要假设。那些一开始没有考虑多种替代解释，而仅仅锁定在单一解释上的分析师，往往会陷入确认偏误的陷阱，只关注支持自己假设的数据，忽视或拒绝不一致的数据。

如果很难找到其他解释，高级分析师会先假设「零假设」，即在脑海中建立两个假设：X 和非 X。非 X 假设用来存放那些看似异常或离群的数据，这些数据在未来可能会提供更准确的诊断。在数据可靠性存疑或信息缺乏的情况下，还应考虑建立一个欺骗假设。

习惯 3：寻找不一致的数据在五个习惯中，寻找不一致数据可能是最难掌握的，但它能在调查或研究时节省大量时间。训练大脑寻找不一致数据的最佳方法是进行一系列的 ACH 练习，这可以帮助分析师更容易识别强有力的反证。高级分析师通常会生成一组全面且互斥的假设。如果遇到与某个假设不符的数据（例如可靠的不在场证明），该假设可以迅速被排除，从而节省时间，集中精力寻找更可能的解决方案。

习惯 4：识别关键驱动因素

在思考问题时，首先要问清楚哪些关键因素可以最好地解释已发生的事情或预测即将发生的情况，这是大师级思维习惯中的第四个。如果能识别出这些关键驱动因素，就能大大减少意外情况的发生。一位经验丰富的分析师应该懂得如何调整这些关键因素的权重（无论是凭直觉，还是使用诸如「多场景生成」或「象限压缩 TM」等技术），以生成一组可信的替代情景，涵盖各种可能的结果。大师级思考者会进一步确保这些情景既包括风险也包括机遇。此外，大师级思考者还会制定一套符合优秀指标五个特征的指标：可观察和收集、有效、可靠、稳定和独特。独特性往往最难满足，需要通过「指标验证器 TM」或其他验证系统来进行测试。7

习惯 5：理解上下文

分析师们常常沉迷于数据的收集和整理工作，结果往往忽略了整体的分析背景。学会停下来思考整个分析的上下文，这是五个关键习惯中最重要的一个。由于大多数分析工作都是在时间紧迫的情况下进行的，分析师们通常会在收到任务后立即开始工作。如果不花时间去理解客户真正的需求，最终的分析可能会不够完善，很多研究工作也可能会白费。我们应该在一开始就学会「站在更高的角度思考」，把自己放在管理层或者提出分析请求的人的位置上。问问自己：「他们需要我提供什么？」「我如何帮助他们定义问题？」以及「我是否需要将他们的问题置于更广泛的背景中？」如果一开始没有这样做，分析师很容易走错方向，或者在协调或编辑过程中发现关键假设不正确时，不得不重新构思整篇论文。

为了帮助分析师掌握这些习惯，并以更严谨和高效的方式进行分析，已经开发了一些免费软件和专有软件。Palo Alto Research Center（PARC）在 Richards J. Heuer 和作者的指导下，开发了一款免费的竞争假设分析（Analysis of Competing Hypothesis）软件。

Globalytica, LLC 提供了一款名为 Te@mACHTM 的网络协作版 ACH，收费合理。该软件是包含在 TH!NK SuiteTM 中的三种技术之一，其他两种是多假设生成器（Multiple Hypotheses GeneratorTM）和指标验证器（Indicators ValidatorTM)。Globalytica 还在开发另外两种工具，Te@m Assumptions CheckTM 和 Quadrant CrunchingTM，这些工具将引导分析师完成关键假设过程，并帮助他们组织生成替代情景。

### Conclusion

Learning how to internalize the five habits into one's normal way of thinking will take a determined effort but can be accomplished within a reasonable period of time. Analysts have frequent opportunities to practice using these techniques both at their jobs and in their private lives. Simply by applying the core techniques—Key Assumptions Check, Multiple Hypothesis Generation, Analysis of Competing Hypotheses, Multiple Scenarios Analysis or Quadrant CrunchingTM, and Indicators and the Indicators Validation—to three to five real problems should implant the basic concepts firmly in any analyst's mind. With every repetition, the five habits described in this article will become more engrained and, over time, they will become instinctive leading to a better analysis produced in a shorter period of time. Few analysts can wish for more: the five habits will increase their impact and save them time.

要将这五种习惯内化到日常思维中需要坚定的努力，但在合理的时间内是可以实现的。分析人员在工作和生活中都有很多机会练习这些技术。通过将关键假设检查、多重假设生成、竞争假设分析、多种情景分析或象限压缩和指标及指标验证等核心技术应用到三到五个实际问题中，基本概念就能牢牢印在分析人员的脑海中。每次练习，这五种习惯都会更加深入，最终变成本能，从而在更短的时间内进行更好的分析。几乎所有分析人员都希望通过这五种习惯提高影响力并节省时间。
