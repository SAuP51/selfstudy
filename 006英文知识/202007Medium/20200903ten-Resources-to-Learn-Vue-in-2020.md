After a few years of working with React, I was getting more and more curious about Vue and its growing ecosystem. I’m thrilled that I now get to dedicate my whole time to it, having recently joined a company that uses Vue for all its front end.

What a blast! The learning curve is nothing compared to React’s. It just feels like everything falls into place, and in the end, I find it so much easier than with React to keep the app clean, readable, maintainable, and scalable. This is my very personal opinion, of course, and I still find lots of advantages to using React. However, the pleasure that has come from working with Vue over the last few weeks has, to my own surprise, brought me to a no-going-back point and I’ll be writing a lot more on Vue from now on.

While it’s true that React has the biggest community at the moment, it also comes with a huge opportunity for us developers to play a role in the Vue ecosystem. That will have a great impact since I’m personally convinced that Vue will take up a much larger market share in the coming years.

Feel excited? I know I am, and as a start, here are ten great resources to learn Vue.js (without forgetting their very high-quality official documentation) so that you can get on that awesome and promising journey too!

## 01. Vue School

[Learn Vue.js from core-team members and industry experts at Vue School](https://vueschool.io/)

The Vue School platform is fully dedicated to Vue and is one of the most exhaustive and qualitative I found. Courses start from a very beginner level and bring you all the way to being a hirable Vue.js developer. New courses are added regularly, which helps to stay up to date with the latest additions to the ecosystem. You might have heard of Vue 3, which is going to be huge. Also, a Vue 3 Master Class is a「work in progress」on Vue School.

After discovering the basic concepts with the beginner courses, the Vue.js Master Class will get you to the next level. This course will teach you everything there is to know about Vue while building a production-ready forum application using the Vue-CLI, single-file components, Vue router, managing state with Vuex, building Vue plug-ins, adding third-party authentication and a real-time database usage with Firebase (if you’ve checked my other articles, you know my love for Firebase), and a lot more. It offers all this while teaching you the best practices regarding the architecture of a clean, scalable, and maintainable Vue application.

Cost: Some courses are free and full access is \$25/mo.

## 02. Vue Mastery

If you knew Code School back in the day, you’ll recognize its former founder Gregg Pollack. He’s backed on Vue Mastery by several Vue.js core team members and other highly skilled developers. On top of that, what I love most about Vue Mastery is that Gregg and its team regularly invite Evan You (creator of Vue.js) for in-depth talks about the heart of Vue’s building, how it works, and where it’s heading. It brings invaluable insight into Vue to master it to its core.

It also starts at the very basics and moves towards more advanced topics at a pace that I found really well balanced.

Cost: Some courses are free and full access is \$19/mo.

## 03. Udemy: Vue JS — The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex)

[Develop with VueJS 2 (Complete Vue.js Router and Vuex Course) | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

If you’re more of a Udemy learner, there’s a Udemy course by one of my favorite instructors, Maximilian Schwarzmüller. This is a project-based course covering every topic from the very basics. I personally didn’t try it, but I’ve followed several courses by Maximilian and always enjoyed the quality of his courses. Also, it has a 4.7/5 score out of almost 40K grades, making it the top Vue.js course on Udemy right now. If you’ve followed it, don’t hesitate to share your thoughts on it in the comments.

Cost: As with any course on Udemy, you can get it for \$10 or less when it’s on sale.

## 04. Scrimba: Learn Vue.js for Free

[Learn to Code with Interactive Tutorials | Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)

Scrimba is a learning platform that I just recently discovered. They cover a wide range of topics, so I’m definitely going to try some of them. They have a pay-per-course pricing model kind of like Udemy. Some of their courses are free, like this one on Vue.

What’s interesting about this one is that they use an interactive online editor. So you’re watching a video course, but at any point, you can jump into the code on the screen to complete an exercise, which makes it very hands-on and engaging.

This free Vue course doesn’t cover very much, though, so it’s more of a way for you to see if you like Scrimba as a learning platform. If so, you can subscribe for \$19/month and follow their Vue Bootcamp, which is much more thorough.

Cost: Freemium at $19/month.

## 05. Scotch.io: Getting Started with Vue.js

[Top Shelf Web Development Training ― Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/)

Scotch.io is a great learning platform mainly for front-end developers, but it also covers some back-end/APIs topics. They have a new course on building an API with Deno, for example, that I’ll be taking a look at very soon. Their Getting Started with Vue.js course is really for beginners, so it’s a good place to start. What I like about their teaching method in this course is that they show you how a feature would look in vanilla JS and then built with Vue.

It only handles the basics, though, so you’ll need to move forward with their intermediate course where you’ll learn about routing and managing the state with Vuex while building an online store. And then you’ll need to move to more complete platforms like Vue Mastery or Vue School.

Cost: Since it’s been acquired by DigitalOcean, all courses on Scotch are completely free.

## 06. Alligator.io — Vue.js Section

[Posts About Vue.js ← Alligator.io](https://alligator.io/vuejs/)

Alligator is a fully free blogging platform with an impressive amount of posts on anything front end. Their section on Vue.js is so wide that you can scroll to the very bottom of it, start from a Hello World, and walk your way up to more complex concepts like lazy-loading, handling online/offline, using third-party tools (Google Analytics, Firebase, Google Maps, Socket.io, etc.), or using Apollo and GraphQL.

Lots of their articles are initially posted on DigitalOcean’s blog, so don’t be surprised if some links (especially the older ones) redirect to it.

Cost: Free

## 07. freeCodeCamp: Learn Vue.js — Full Course for Beginners

[Learn Vue.js - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vue-js-full-course/)

As we could expect from one of the most complete learning platforms in our industry, freeCodeCamp offers a free three-hour video course on Vue.js.

In my opinion, this course is way less engaging than others from this list. Regardless, it’s very thorough, and if you want to quickly cover as many Vue concepts as possible, this one goes through all you need to know to get started on a Vue project in under three hours.

Cost: Free

## 08. Medium: How to Build Sudoku in Vue.js

I love posts that are dedicated to building a fun project from scratch. There’s no better way to learn than by doing, and I’m very much willing to write some similar project-based articles in the future. If you have requests for projects you’d like to learn how to build with Vue or React, don’t hesitate to share in the comments!

Moving along on the learning-by-building path, freeCodeCamp has a complete guide to building a memory card game by Tushar Gugnani.

Cost: Free

## 10. Hackernoon: How to Build a Portfolio Site Using Vue and Cosmic JS

Once you’ve developed all the skills you need to get hired as a Vue.js developer, you’ll need a portfolio to let companies and recruiters know about your great new Vue.js acumen. This final tutorial will help you do just that: Build your own portfolio site using Vue.js — and discover the headless CMS Cosmic JS in the process.
