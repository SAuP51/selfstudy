### Abstract

I present an account of the origins and development of the multicomponent approach to working memory, making a distinction between the overall theoretical framework, which has remained relatively stable, and the attempts to build more specific models within this framework.

I follow this with a brief discussion of alternative models and their relationship to the framework. I conclude with speculations on further developments and a comment on the value of attempting to apply models and theories beyond the laboratory studies on which they are typically based.

本文介绍了工作记忆多组成部分理论的起源与发展。本文首先区分了理论的总体框架和在这一框架下构建的更为具体的模型之间的差异，前者保持了相对的稳定性，而后者则体现了在此理论基础上的深入探索与尝试。

紧接着，文章简要分析了其他模型与该框架之间的联系与差异。最后，文章对未来可能的发展方向进行了展望，并对在实验室研究基础上将这些模型和理论应用到更广泛领域的尝试价值进行了探讨。

WORKING MEMORY: THEORIES, MODELS, AND CONTROVERSIES

I was honored, pleased, and challenged by the invitation to write this prefatory chapter, pleased because it offered the chance to take a broad and somewhat autobiographical view of my principal area of interest, working memory (WM), but challenged by the potential magnitude of the task. The topic of working memory has increased dramatically in citation counts since the early years, not all of course related to or supportive of my own work, but a recent attempt to review it (Baddeley 2007) ended with more than 50 pages of references. What follows is a partial, as opposed to impartial, account of the origins of the concept of multicomponent working memory (M-WM) and of my own views on its subsequent development. My first draft would have filled the chapter page allowance with references; I apologize to all of those whose work should have been cited and is not.

I entered psychology as a student at University College London in 1953, a very exciting time for the field of psychology, which had benefited greatly from developments during the Second World War, where theory was enriched by the need to tackle practical problems.

As a result, prewar issues such as the conflict between Gestalt psychology and neobehaviorism began to be challenged by new data and new ideas, some based on cybernetics, the study of control systems, with others influenced by the newly developed digital computers. This in turn led to a renewed interest in the philosophy of science as applied to psychology. Typical questions included, is psychology a science?; if so, is it cumulative or are we doomed to keep on asking the same questions, as appeared to be the case in philosophy? What would a good psychological theory look like?

As students we were offered two answers to this question. The first, championed by Cambridge philosopher Richard Braithwaite (1953), regarded Newton's Principia as the model to which scientific theories should aspire, involving as it does postulates, laws, equations, and predictions. Within psychology, the Newtonian model was explicitly copied by Clark Hull in his attempt to produce a general theory of learning, principally based on the study of maze learning in the albino rat.

撰写这篇序言对我而言既是荣誉，也是挑战。它不仅让我有机会广泛且从个人经历的角度回顾我最感兴趣的领域 —— 工作记忆，同时也让我面临这一任务的庞大挑战。尽管工作记忆这个话题自早期以来在引用量上急剧增加，其中不乏对我的工作的引用和支持，但是当我尝试回顾此领域时（Baddeley 2007），仅参考文献就超过了 50 页。这里我将分享关于多组分工作记忆概念起源以及我对其发展的看法的一部分视角，这是出于个人立场而非完全客观的叙述。我的初稿中引用的文献量巨大，足以填满整个章节，对于那些应被引用但未被提及的研究，我在此表示歉意。

我在 1953 年作为学生加入了伦敦大学学院心理学系，那是一个对心理学领域极为激动人心的时期。心理学从二战期间的发展中获得了巨大的益处，理论的丰富源于解决实际问题的需求。

这导致了战前一些问题，如格式塔心理学与新行为主义之间的冲突，开始受到新数据和新理念的挑战。这些新思想一部分基于控制论（研究控制系统的学科），另一部分受到了新开发的数字计算机的影响。这也重新点燃了对心理学中应用科学哲学的兴趣。人们开始探讨心理学是否为一门科学，如果是，它是累积性的还是我们注定要反复探讨相同的问题，正如在哲学中所发生的那样？一个优秀的心理学理论应该是怎样的？

我们得到了两种回答。第一种，由剑桥哲学家 Richard Braithwaite 在 1953 年提出，他认为牛顿的《原理》应是科学理论的典范，包含了假设、定律、方程和预测。在心理学领域，Clark Hull 尝试通过研究白鼠的迷宫学习来构建一个一般性的学习理论，这一尝试明确地复制了牛顿模型。

An alternative model of theorizing came from Oxford, where Stephen Toulmin (1953) argued that theories were like maps, ways of organizing our existing knowledge of the world, providing tools both for interacting with the world and for further exploration. Edward Tolman in Stanford had a view of learning in rats that fitted this model, using it to challenge Hull's neo-behaviorist approach. This raised the crucial question as to how you might decide between the two apparently opposing views. The dominant answer to that question, in the United Kingdom at least, was provided by Karl Popper (1959), a Viennese-trained philosopher who argued strongly that a valid theory should make clear, testable predictions, allowing the rival theories to confront each other in the all-important "crucial experiment" that settles the issue. This approach was closer in spirit to Hull than to Tolman.

My own first published study (Baddeley 1960) attempted just such a crucial experiment, predicting that rats would be smarter than they should be according to Hullian theory, and demonstrating, to my own satisfaction at least, that this was the case. Alas, by the time it was published, the whole field of learning theory seemed to have collapsed. Neither side was able to deliver a knockout blow, and people simply abandoned the research area. I resolved at that point that if I myself were to develop a theory, it would be based very closely on the evidence, which would survive even if the theory proved totally wrong. It is an approach I have followed ever since.

But what is the answer to our original question, should theorists be architects, building elegant structures such as Newton did, or should they be explorers, gradually extending the theory on the basis of more and more evidence, as in the case of Darwin? Clearly both Newton and Darwin got it right, but for fields at a different stage of development. Newton claimed that his success resulted from "standing on the shoulders of giants," who no doubt stood on the shoulders of lesser mortals like ourselves. Darwin had few such giants available. I suggest that any complete theory is likely to require explorers in its initial stages and architects to turn the broad concepts into detailed models. I myself am very much at the explorer end of the continuum, but I fully accept the importance of the skills of the architect if theory is to develop.

另一种理论化思路源自牛津，Stephen Toulmin（1953）提出，理论犹如地图，是我们组织对世界知识认知的方式，不仅为我们与世界互动提供了工具，也为进一步的探索提供了可能。而在斯坦福，Edward Tolman 就老鼠的学习提出了一个符合此模型的观点，他使用这一模型挑战了 Hull 的新行为主义方法。这引发了一个关键问题：如何在两种看似对立的观点之间做出选择。在英国，至少，对这个问题的主流回答是由 Karl Popper（1959）提出的。作为一名接受维也纳训练的哲学家，他强调，一个有效的理论应当能够提出清晰且可测试的预测，让相互竞争的理论在决定性的实验中直面对抗，从而解决争议。这种方法在精神上更靠近 Hull 而非 Tolman。

我的第一项公开发表的研究（Baddeley 1960）正是尝试进行这样一项决定性实验，预测老鼠的智力会超出 Hull 理论的预期，并至少在我自己看来，证明了这一点。遗憾的是，当这项研究发表时，整个学习理论领域似乎已经陷入崩溃。两方都未能达成决定性的胜利，研究领域因此被遗弃。我那时决定，如果我要发展自己的理论，它必须紧紧基于证据，即便理论最终被彻底推翻，这些证据也能够存留。这是一种我此后一直坚持的方法。

但对于我们最初的问题，理论家应当成为建筑师，构建像牛顿那样的优雅结构，还是应当作为探索者，像达尔文那样在更多证据基础上逐步扩展理论呢？显然，牛顿和达尔文都正确了，但他们适用于处于不同发展阶段的领域。牛顿自称其成功是因为「站在巨人的肩膀上」，这些巨人无疑又是站在像我们这样的凡人肩膀上的。而达尔文可用的这样的巨人并不多。我认为，任何完整的理论在初期阶段都需要探索者，以及需要建筑师将广阔的概念转化为详细模型。我自认更偏向于探索者，但我完全认可，如果理论要得到发展，建筑师的技艺同样重要。

My research career really began with my arrival at the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Unit (APU) in Cambridge. Its role was to form a bridge between psychological theory and practical problems, and the year I arrived, Donald Broadbent, its director, had just published his seminal book, Perception and Communication, which provided one of the sparks that ignited what subsequently became known as the cognitive revolution. I was assigned to work on optimizing the design of postal codes, which led me to combine the classic tradition of nonsense syllable learning with new ideas from information theory, resulting in my generating memorable postal codes for each town in the United Kingdom. The Post Office thanked me and went on their way regardless; the code they adopted could, however, have been much worse, as is indeed the case in some countries, but that is another story.

By this time my approach to theory was evolving away from Popper's idea of the need for crucial experiments, largely on the grounds that clear predictions only appeared to be possible in situations that were far narrower than the ones I found interesting. I subsequently discovered that within the philosophy of science, Lakatos (1976), and allegedly Popper himself, had subsequently abandoned the reliance on falsification, arguing instead that the mark of a good theory is that it should be productive, not only giving an account of existing knowledge, but also generating fruitful questions that will increase our knowledge. This more map-like view of theory is the one that I continue to take.

我的研究生涯的开端是我加入了位于剑桥的医学研究委员会应用心理学单位（APU），一个旨在将心理学理论与实践问题联系起来的机构。我到达的那一年，单位主任 Donald Broadbent 刚发布了他的开创性著作《感知与沟通》，该书成为了后来所称认知革命的一把火花。我负责的任务是优化邮政编码的设计，这个任务将我对无意义音节学习的经典研究与信息理论的新思想相结合，最终我为英国每个城镇设计了易于记忆的邮政编码。尽管邮政局对此表示了感谢，但他们最终选择的编码系统还是与我提出的有所不同；虽然他们的选择比某些国家的情况要好，但这已经是另外一个故事了。

随着时间的推移，我对理论的方法开始从 Popper 所强调的需要决定性实验的观点演变。主要原因是，在我感兴趣的广泛领域内，清晰的预测似乎只能在更为狭窄的情境中做出。后来，我发现科学哲学领域内，Lakatos（1976 年），乃至 Popper 本人，都逐渐摒弃了对反证法的依赖，转而认为一个理论的优势在于其生产力 —— 不仅能解释已有的知识，还能提出能够拓展我们知识边界的有益问题。这种将理论视为知识地图的观点，是我持续采纳的视角。

#### Short-Term Memory

The term "working memory" evolved from the earlier concept of short-term memory (STM), and the two are still on occasion used interchangeably. I will use STM to refer to the simple temporary storage of information, in contrast to WM, which implies a combination of storage and manipulation.

My interest in STM began during my time at the APU in Cambridge and was prompted by an applied problem, that of finding a way of evaluating the quality of telephone lines that might be more effective than a simple listening test. My PhD supervisor Conrad had recently discovered the acoustic similarity effect. He was studying memory for proposed telephone dialing codes when he noted that even with visual presentation, memory errors resembled acoustic mis-hearing errors (e.g., v for b), and that memory for similar sequences (b g t p c) was poorer than for dissimilar (k r l q y), concluding that STM depends on an acoustic code (Conrad & Hull 1964).

I decided to see if the acoustic similarity effect could be used to provide sensitive indirect measure of telephone line quality. It did not; the effects of noise and similarity were simply additive, but I was intrigued by the sheer magnitude of the similarity effect. Similarity was a central variable within the dominant stimulusresponse interference theory of verbal learning (see Osgood 1949), but the type of similarity seemed not to be regarded as important. So, would Conrad's effect generalize to other types of similarity in STM?

「工作记忆」一词是从更早的「短期记忆」（STM）概念演化而来的，尽管两者在某些情况下仍可以交替使用。在这里，我将「短期记忆」定义为信息的简单临时存储，而「工作记忆」则涉及到信息存储与处理的结合。

我的对短期记忆的兴趣源于我在剑桥的医学研究委员会应用心理学单位（APU）工作期间，起因是一个实际问题：探索一种评估电话线路质量的方法，这种方法希望能比传统的听力测试更为有效。我的博士导师 Conrad 最近揭示了声学相似性效应。在研究推荐的电话拨号码记忆时，他发现即便是通过视觉呈现，记忆错误也倾向于与声音误听（例如，将 v 听成 b）类似，对于声学上相似的序列（如 b g t p c）的记忆表现不如声学上不相似的序列（如 k r l q y），从而得出结论，短期记忆依赖于声学编码（Conrad & Hull 1964）。

我想要探究声学相似性效应是否能成为评估电话线质量的一个敏感而间接的指标。结果并非如预期，噪音和相似性的效应只是简单相加，但相似性效应的显著程度引起了我的极大兴趣。在当时主流的口头学习的刺激 - 反应干扰理论中，相似性是一个核心变量（参见 Osgood 1949），但对相似性类型的重要性却未受到足够重视。因此，我开始思考 Conrad 所发现的效应是否可以扩展到短期记忆中其它类型的相似性。

I tested this, comparing recall of sequences with five phonologically similar words (man, mat, can, map, cat), five dissimilar words (e.g., pit, day, cow, pen, sup), and five semantically similar sequences (huge, big, wide, large, tall ) with five dissimilar (wet, soft, old, late, good ). I found (Baddeley 1966a) a huge effect of phonological similarity1 (80% sequences correct for dissimilar, 10% for similar) and a small but significant effect for semantic similarity (71% versus 65%). I went on to demonstrate that this pattern reversed when long-term memory (LTM) was required by using ten-word lists and several learning trials; semantic similarity then proved critical (Baddeley 1966b). I concluded that there were two storage systems, a short-term phonological and a long-term semantically based system. My telephony project was passed on to a newly arrived colleague and I was left free to explore this line of basic research.

I saw my work as fitting into a pattern of evidence for separate STM and LTM stores. Other evidence came from amnesic patients who had preserved STM and impaired LTM, while other patients showed the reverse pattern (Shallice &Warrington 1970). A third source of evidence came from two-component memory tasks, which comprised a durable LTM component together with a temporary component. A typical example of this was the recency effect in free recall (Glanzer 1972); the last few words of a list are well recalled on immediate test but not after a brief filled delay, unlike earlier items.

[1] I subsequently abandoned the term "acoustic similarity" because it suggested an input modality-based system, which is not the case; I mistakenly assumed that phonological was a more neutral term. It was not intended as a statement of the linguistic basis of the memory system, which remains an open question.

我进行了实验，对比了五个音韵相近的词语（如 man, mat, can, map, cat）、五个音韵不相近的词语（如 pit, day, cow, pen, sup）以及五个语义相近（如 huge, big, wide, large, tall）和五个语义不相近（如 wet, soft, old, late, good）的序列的回忆效果。我发现（Baddeley 1966a），音韵相似性对回忆有巨大影响（音韵不相似序列正确率为 80%，音韵相似序列为 10%），而语义相似性虽影响较小但仍显著（71% 对比 65%）。进一步的研究显示，当转向需要长期记忆（LTM）的任务，如通过使用十个词的列表和多次学习试验时，情况则反转，这时语义相似性成为决定性因素（Baddeley 1966b）。由此，我得出结论，我们的记忆系统由两部分构成：一个短期的音韵存储系统和一个长期的基于语义的存储系统。我的电话线质量评估项目随后转交给了一位新加入的同事，这让我有机会自由地继续探索这一基础研究领域。

我的研究被视为支持短期记忆（STM）和长期记忆（LTM）为分离存储的证据之一。其他支持证据包括对于健忘症患者的观察，他们的 STM 保留完好而 LTM 受损，反之亦然（Shallice & Warrington 1970）。第三方面的证据则来源于包含持久 LTM 组件和临时组件的双组分记忆任务。其中一个典型例子是自由回忆测试中的近因效应（Glanzer 1972）：列表中的最后几个词在立即测试中回忆良好，但经过短暂的间隔后就不再如此，这与列表中早期的条目不同。

[1] 由于「声学相似性」这一术语暗示了一个基于输入模态的系统，而实际情况并非如此，我后来放弃使用它。我错误地以为「音韵」是一个更中立的术语。这个选择并不旨在对记忆系统的语言学基础做出断言，这个问题仍然悬而未决。

At this point, my simple assumption of two stores, with STM phonologically based and LTM semantically based, led to some clear predictions. Amnesic patients should have semantic coding problems, and recency should be acoustically based. Studies based on amnesic patients suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome did suggest a semantic encoding deficit (Cermak et al. 1974), but our own work showed no evidence of such a deficit (Baddeley & Warrington 1970), and later work (Cermak & Reale 1978) attributed their previously observed deficit to additional executive problems, often found in Korsakoff's syndrome.

In the case of two-component tasks, it became clear that recency did not depend on verbal STM (Baddeley & Hitch 1977) and that the use of semantic or phonological coding was strategy dependent. Phonological coding of verbal material is rapid, attentionally undemanding, and very effective for storing serial order. Semantic coding can be rapid for meaningful sequences such as sentences, but it is much harder to use for storing the order of unrelated words (Baddeley & Levy 1971). We also showed that word sequences can simultaneously be encoded both phonologically and semantically (Baddeley & Ecob 1970) and that standard tasks such as immediate serial recall can reflect both long-term and short-term components, each of which may be influenced by either phonological or semantic factors. In short, STM, retention of material over a brief period, may be based on either phonological or semantic coding. The former is easy to set up but readily forgotten; the latter may take longer to set up but tends to be more durable. Both can operate over brief delays, and the fact that we can learn new words indicates that long-term phonological learning also occurs.

It is worth emphasizing the need to distinguish between STM as a label for a paradigm in which small amounts of information are stored over brief delays and STM as a theoretical storage system. This point was made by Waugh & Norman (1965) and by Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968), but it has often been neglected in subsequent years. Material tested after a brief delay (i.e., an STM task) is likely to reflect both LTM and some form of temporary storage.

在这一点上，我对两种存储系统（STM 以音韵为基础，LTM 以语义为基础）的简单假定引出了一些明确的预测。这意味着，健忘症患者将面临语义编码的难题，而近因效应则应该是基于声音的。对患有科萨科夫综合症的健忘症患者进行的研究似乎支持了存在语义编码的不足（Cermak 等人，1974 年），但我们自己的研究未发现此类不足（Baddeley & Warrington 1970），后续研究（Cermak & Reale 1978）则将这一发现的不足归咎于科萨科夫综合症常见的额外执行功能问题。

在涉及两个组件的任务中，显而易见的是，近因效应并不依赖于口头的 STM（Baddeley & Hitch 1977），且采用语义或音韵编码的选择依赖于使用的策略。对于言语材料，音韵编码既快速又不需要过多注意力，非常适合存储序列顺序。而对于有意义的序列如句子，语义编码虽快，但用于存储不相关单词顺序则较为困难（Baddeley & Levy 1971）。我们还发现，单词序列可以同时进行音韵和语义编码（Baddeley & Ecob 1970），并且像即时序列回忆这样的标准任务可以反映长短期组件，这些组件可能受到音韵或语义因素的影响。简言之，短期保持的材料可能基于音韵或语义编码。前者容易设置但容易忘记；后者设置可能较慢但更为持久。这两种编码都能在短时间延迟中工作，我们能够学习新单词的事实说明长期的音韵学习也是发生的。

需要强调的是，区分 STM 作为存储少量信息的短暂延迟的范式，以及 STM 作为理论上的存储系统的重要性。这一观点由 Waugh & Norman（1965）和 Atkinson & Shiffrin（1968）提出，但在后来经常被忽略。在短暂延迟后进行测试的材料（即 STM 任务）很可能同时反映了 LTM 和某种形式的临时存储。

#### Evolution of a Multicomponent Theory

After nine years at the APU, I moved to Sussex into a new department of experimental psychology, where, in 1972, I was joined by Graham Hitch as a post-doctoral fellow on my first research grant. After a first degree in physics, he had done a psychology MSc in Sussex and a PhD with Broadbent at the APU. We had proposed (perhaps unwisely) to investigate the link between STM and LTM, beginning our grant just when the previously popular field of STM was downsizing itself following criticism of the dominant Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968) model for three reasons. First, the model assumed that merely holding information in STM would guarantee transfer to LTM, whereas Craik & Lockhart (1972) showed that the nature of processing is crucial, with deeper, more elaborate processing leading to better learning. Second, its assumption that the short-term store was essential for access to LTM proved to be inconsistent with neuropsychological evidence. Patients with a digit span of only two items and an absence of recency in free recall should, according to Atkinson and Shiffrin, have a defective short-term store that should lead to impaired LTM. This was not the case. Third, given that Atkinson and Shiffrin assumed their short-term store to be a working memory, playing an important general role in cognition, such patients should have major intellectual deficits. They did not. One patient, for instance, was an efficient secretary, and another ran a shop and a family. Interest in the field began to move from STM to LTM, to semantic memory and levels of processing.

多组份理论发展史

在 APU（应用心理单位）工作了九年之后，1972 年，我转到了苏塞克斯大学的一个全新实验心理学系。不久，格雷厄姆·希奇博士作为我的第一笔研究经费支持的博士后研究员加入了我。希奇博士拥有物理学本科背景，随后在苏塞克斯大学攻读心理学硕士，并在 APU 跟随布罗德本特教授完成了他的博士学位研究。我们有些冒险地提出要探索短时记忆（STM）与长时记忆（LTM）之间的联系，这个项目的开始正值 STM 研究领域因受到对当时主流的 Atkinson & Shiffrin（1968 年）模型的三方面批评而开始缩减其研究规模。首先，该模型认为只要在 STM 中保持信息，就能自动转移至 LTM，但克莱克和洛克哈特在 1972 年的研究表明，信息处理的深度和细致程度对学习成效至关重要。其次，该模型将短期记忆库视为访问 LTM 的必要条件，这与神经心理学的发现不符。例如，某些患者虽然数字记忆跨度仅为两项，并且在自由回忆测试中没有显示出近因效应，但他们的长期记忆并未受损，这与 Atkinson 和 Shiffrin 的预期相悖。第三，按照 Atkinson 和 Shiffrin 的看法，既然他们认为短期记忆库是一种在认知过程中发挥广泛作用的工作记忆，那么受损的短期记忆库应会导致严重的智力缺陷，但实际情况并非如此，例如，一位患者能高效地担任秘书工作，另一位则同时经营着商店和家庭。随着时间的推移，研究人员的兴趣从 STM 转移到了 LTM，进而到语义记忆和处理级别的研究。

Graham Hitch and I did not have access to these rare but theoretically important STM-deficit patients and instead decided that we would try to manufacture our own "patients" using student volunteers. We did so, not by removing the relevant part of their brain, but by functionally disabling it by requiring participants to do a concurrent task that was likely to occupy the limited-capacity short-term storage system to varying degrees. The concurrent task we chose was serial verbal recall of sequences of spoken digits. As sequence length increased, the digits should occupy more and more of available capacity, with the result that performance on any task relying on WM should be progressively impaired. In one study, participants performed a visually presented grammatical reasoning task while hearing and attempting to recall digit sequences of varying length. Response time increased linearly with concurrent digit load. However, the disruption was far from catastrophic: around 50% for the heaviest load, and perhaps more strikingly, the error rate remained constant at around 5%. Our results therefore suggested a clear involvement of whatever system underpins digit span, but not a crucial one. Performance slows systematically but does not break down. We found broadly similar results in studies investigating both verbal LTM and language comprehension, and on the basis of these, abandoned the assumption that WM comprised a single unitary store, proposing instead the three-component system shown in Figure 1 (Baddeley & Hitch 1974).

Figure 1 The original Baddeley & Hitch (1974) working memory model.

We aimed to keep our proposed system as simple as possible, but at the same time, potentially capable of being applied across a wide range of cognitive activities. We decided to split attentional control from temporary storage, which earlier research suggested might rely on separate verbal and visuo-spatial short-term systems, all of which were limited in capacity. We labeled the central controller as a "central executive" (CE), initially referring to the verbal system as the "articulatory loop," after the subvocal rehearsal assumed to be necessary to maintain information, and later adopting the term "phonological loop" to emphasize storage rather than rehearsal. We termed the third component the "visuo-spatial sketchpad," leaving open the issue of whether it was basically visual, spatial, or both.

格雷厄姆·希奇和我未能接触到那些少见但对理论极其重要的短时记忆缺失患者，因此我们决定尝试自己「制造」患者，方法是利用学生志愿者。我们并没有通过手术移除他们大脑的某部分，而是通过让他们同时进行另一项任务来在功能上限制他们的大脑，这项任务很可能会占用有限的短期存储系统的不同程度的容量。我们选定的这项任务是要求他们序列回忆口头给出的数字。随着数字序列长度的增加，这些数字将占用更多的存储容量，导致依赖工作记忆的任何任务的性能逐渐下降。在一项实验中，参与者一边听并尝试回忆不同长度的数字序列，一边进行视觉呈现的语法推理任务。我们发现，随着同时进行的数字任务负载的增加，反应时间线性延长。但是，这种干扰远没有达到灾难性的程度：在最重的负载下，性能下降约 50%，更令人注意的是，错误率保持在大约 5% 的水平。因此，我们的研究结果清晰地显示了某个系统在维持数字记忆跨度方面的参与，但这种参与并非决定性的。虽然性能会系统地减慢，但并不会完全崩溃。在研究口头长时记忆和语言理解时，我们发现了类似的结果。基于这些发现，我们放弃了工作记忆包含单一统一存储的假设，转而提出了一个由三个部分组成的系统，即 Baddeley & Hitch（1974 年）的工作记忆模型。

图 1 Baddeley & Hitch（1974）工作记忆模型的原始图。

我们设想的系统尽可能简单，但同时又能够广泛适用于各种认知活动。我们选择将注意力控制与暂时性存储分离，这是基于早期研究的建议，即可能依赖于独立的口头和视觉 - 空间短期记忆系统，这些系统都有容量限制。我们把这个中心控制单元称为「中央执行器」，并最初将处理口头信息的系统称为「言语循环」，后来改称「语音循环」，以强调其存储而非重复的功能。我们将第三个组成部分命名为「视觉 - 空间草图本」，这留下了一个问题：它基本上是视觉的、空间的还是两者兼而有之。

We began by focusing on the phonological loop on the grounds that it seemed the most tractable system to investigate, given the very extensive earlier research on verbal STM. At this point, I unexpectedly received an invitation from Gordon Bower to contribute a chapter to an influential annual publication presenting recent advances in the area of learning and memory.We hesitated; our model was far from complete, should we perhaps wait? We went ahead anyhow (Baddeley & Hitch 1974), presenting a model that is still not complete nearly 40 years and many publications later.

Over the next decade we continued to explore the model and its potential for application beyond the cognitive laboratory. At this point I agreed to summarize our progress in a monograph (Baddeley 1986). This was approaching completion when I realized that I had said nothing about the CE, very much a case of Hamlet without the prince. My reluctance to tackle the executive stemmed from two sources: first, its probable complexity, and second, because of the crucial importance of its attentional capacity. Although there were a number of highly developed and sophisticated theories of attention, most were concerned with the role of attention in perception, whereas the principal role of the CE was the attentional control of action. The one directly relevant article I could find (Norman & Shallice 1986) appeared as a chapter because of the difficulty of persuading a journal to accept it (Shallice 2010, personal communication), alas, all too common with papers presenting new ideas.




Norman and Shallice proposed that action is controlled in two rather separate ways. One is

based on well-learned habits or schemata, demanding little in the way of attentional control. An example of this might be the activity

of driving a well-learned route to your office.

This source of control can be overridden by a

second process, the supervisory attentional system (SAS), which responds to situations that

are not capable of being handled by habit-based

processes, for example, coping with the closure

of a road on your normal route.

With some relief, I incorporated the

Norman and Shallice model into my own concept of a CE, producing a book (Baddeley 1986)

that attempted to pull together developments in

WM that had occurred in the previous decade

and then apply them to data from the literature

in three areas: fluent reading, the development

of WM in children, and the effects of aging.

Although I tended to refer to our proposals as

a model, using the criteria proposed earlier, it

might better be regarded as a simple theory,

in the sense of Toulmin's idea of theories as

maps, linking together existing knowledge and

encouraging further investigation. If so, it was a

map with many blank areas that I hoped would

be filled by myself and others, leading in due

course to more detailed modeling.

What then are the essentials of the broad

theory? The basis is the assumption that it

is useful to postulate a hypothetical limitedcapacity system that provides the temporary

storage and manipulation of information that is

necessary for performing a wide range of cognitive activities. A second assumption is that this

system is not unitary but can be split into an executive component and at least two temporary

storage systems, one concerning speech and

sound while the other is visuo-spatial. These

three components could be regarded as modules in the sense that they comprise processes

and storage systems that are tightly interlinked

within the module and more loosely linked

across modules, with somewhat more remote

connections to other systems such as perception and LTM. I regard the very rigid definition of modularity by Fodor (1983) as unhelpful

and neuropsychologically implausible. A consequence of my rejection of Fodorian simplicity

is the assumption that each of these systems can

be fractionated into subsystems and that these

will be linked to perceptual and LTM processes

in ways that require further investigation.

My overall view of WM therefore comprised, and still comprises, a relatively loose

theoretical framework rather than a precise

model that allows specific predictions. The

success of such a framework should be based,

as suggested by Lakatos (1976), not only on

its capacity to explain existing data but also on

its productivity in generating good, tractable

questions linked to empirical methods that can

be widely applied. The proposed components

of WM are discussed in turn, beginning with

the phonological loop.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

PHONOLOGICAL LOOP

We saw the phonological loop as a relatively

modular system comprising a brief store together with a means of maintaining information

by vocal or subvocal rehearsal. In the 1960s, a

number of studies attempted to decide whether

forgetting in the STM system was based on

trace decay or interference (see Baddeley 1976).

None of these studies proved to be conclusive,

a state of affairs that remains true, in my own

opinion. We opted to assume a process of trace

decay, partly on the basis of our results and

partly because it avoided the need to become involved in the many controversies surrounding

traditional approaches to interference theory

at the time (see Baddeley 1976, chapter 5), although we did assume a limited-capacity store,

which in turn implies some unspecified form

of interference, either by displacement or by

overwriting. We used existing results, together

with our own subsequent studies, to create a

simple model that is based on the method of

converging operations. This involves combining evidence from a range of different phenomena, each consistent with the model, but each

individually explicable in other ways. If none

of the competing interpretations are able to explain the whole pattern, whereas the phonological loop model can, then this provides valuable

support. This approach has the advantage of

potentially producing a robust model, but it has

the disadvantage of being required to confront

a range of different possible alternative explanations for each individual phenomenon.

The Phonological Similarity Effect

As described above, this is regarded as an indication that phonological storage is involved.

Its effect is principally on the storage of order

information. Indeed, item information may be

helped by similarity since it places constraints

on possible responses. For this reason, studies

that specifically attempt to investigate the loop

tend to minimize the need to retain item information by repeatedly using the same limited set, for example, consonants. Studies using

open sets, for instance, different words for each

sequence, are more likely to reflect loss of item

information and to show semantic and other

LTM-based effects.

The Word Length Effect

We assumed that vocal or subvocal rehearsal

was likely to occur in real time, with longer

words taking longer and hence allowing more

time for trace decay, thus leading to poorer

performance. We studied the immediate recall

of sequences of five words ranging in length

from one syllable (e.g., pen day hot cow tub) to

five syllables (e.g., university, tuberculosis, opportunity, hippopotamus, refrigerator) and found that

performance declined systematically with word

length. As expected, when participants were required to read out words of different lengths

as rapidly as possible, there was a close correspondence between word length and articulation time. The simple way of expressing our

results was to note that people are able to remember as many words as they can articulate in

two seconds (Baddeley et al. 1975b).

We interpreted our data by assuming that

longer words take longer to rehearse, resulting

in more trace decay and poorer recall. Such decay is also likely to continue during the slower

spoken recall of longer words. We presented

evidence for time-based decay, which has

since faced challenge and counter-challenge

(see Baddeley 2007, pp. 43–49). Fortunately,

however, the general hypothesis of a phonological loop will function equally well with

either a decay or interference interpretation

of short-term forgetting, illustrating the value

of combining a broad theoretical map while

leaving more detailed modeling to be decided

by further experimentation.

Articulatory Suppression

If the word length effect is dependent on

subvocalization, then preventing it should

eliminate the effect. This is indeed the case

(Baddeley et al. 1975b). When participants

are required to continuously utter a single

word such as "the," performance drops and is

equivalent for long and short words. Suppression also removes the phonological similarity

effect for visually presented materials but not

when presentation is auditory (Baddeley et al.

1984). We interpret this as suggesting that

spoken material gains obligatory access to the

phonological store, whereas written material

needs to be subvocalized if it is to register.

The claim that auditory presentation allows

a phonological trace to be laid down despite

suppression has recently been challenged. Jones

et al. (2006) have suggested that the effect is limited to the recency component of immediate serial recall, suggesting that it is better regarded

as a perceptual effect. However, although this

may be true for long lists, shorter lists show an

effect that operates throughout the serial position curve (Baddeley & Larsen 2007).

Irrelevant Sound Effects

Colle & Welsh (1976) required their participants to recall sequences of visually presented

digits presented either in silence or accompanied by white noise or by speech in an unfamiliar language that they were told to ignore. Only

the spoken material disrupted performance on

the visually presented digits, an effect that was

independent of the loudness of the irrelevant

sound sources. Pierre Salame, a French visitor

to Cambridge, and I followed up and extended

PS63CH01-Baddeley ARI 31 October 2011 10:12

Colle's work, demonstrating that visual STM

was disrupted to the same extent by irrelevant

words and nonsense syllables; indeed, irrelevant digits had no more effect on digit recall

than did nondigit words containing the same

phonemes (e.g., one two replaced by tun woo),

suggesting that interference was operating at a

prelexical level. We did, however, find slightly

less disruption of our monosyllabic digits from

bisyllabic words than from monosyllabic words,

concluding rather too hastily that this suggested

that interference was dependent on phonological similarity (Salame & Baddeley 1986). Like

Colle and Welsh, we suggested an interpretation in terms of some form of mnemonic masking. This proved to be something of an embarrassment when it was clearly demonstrated that

irrelevant items that were phonemically similar

to the remembered sequence were no more disruptive than dissimilar items ( Jones & Macken

1995, Larsen et al. 2000). Unfortunately, our

initial hypothesis came to be regarded as central toWM, despite our subsequent withdrawal,

a salutary lesson in premature theorizing.

Meanwhile Dylan Jones and colleagues in

Wales were developing a very extended program of research on irrelevant sound. They

showed that STM was disrupted not only

by irrelevant speech, but also by a range of

other sounds, including, for example, fluctuating tones ( Jones & Macken 1993). In order

to account for their results they proposed the

"changing state" hypothesis, whereby the crucial feature was that the irrelevant sound needed

to fluctuate. Jones (1993) coupled this with the

object-orientated episodic record (OOE-R) hypothesis, which assumes that both digits and irrelevant sounds are represented as potentially

competing paths on a multidimensional surface.

The OOE-R hypothesis is not spelled out in detail but would appear to assume that serial order

is based on chaining, whereby each item acts as

a stimulus for the response that follows, which

in turn acts as a further stimulus.

Retaining Serial Order

A typical memory span is around six or seven

digits, not because the digits themselves are

forgotten, but rather because their order is

lost. Retaining serial order is a crucial demand

for a wide range of activities, notably including language, in which sequences of sounds

within words and words within sentences must

be maintained, and skilled motor performance

such as striking a ball with a bat or playing the

piano. However, as Lashley (1951) points out, it

is far from easy to explain how this is achieved.

The most obvious hypothesis is through the

previously described mechanism of chaining

through sequential associations. However, this

has some major potential problems; if one item

is lost, then the chain is broken and subsequent

recall should fail, and yet it is often the case that

despite errors in the middle of a sequence, the

latter part is reproduced correctly. Similarly, if

an item is repeated within the chain (e.g., 753

596), then the chain should be disrupted, but

this disruption, when it occurs, is typically far

from dramatic.

A third phenomenon appears to be even

more problematic. This again is an effect that

was discovered when trying to solve a practical problem, that of trying to reduce the negative impact of phonological similarity on the

recall of postal codes. It seemed plausible to me

to assume that the principal effect of similarity would come from having two or more similar items bunched together, in which case it

might prove possible to greatly minimize the effect by alternating similar and dissimilar items

(e.g., dfvkpl ). The results were disappointing;

the similar items appeared to be just as liable

to be forgotten when sandwiched between dissimilar items as when they were adjacent, so

we put the experiment to one side. It was only

later, when I was attempting to pin down the

nature of the phonological loop effect, that I

realized that our result had clear implications

for theories of serial order retrieval in general

(Baddeley 1968) and were in particular inconsistent with hypotheses that depended upon

chaining. The argument goes as follows: If one

considers a sequence of six letters as a series of

pairs, then we know that the principal source of

interference comes from similarity at the stimulus level, which then gives rise to errors on the

PS63CH01-Baddeley ARI 31 October 2011 10:12

subsequent response (Osgood 1949).We would

therefore expect errors to follow the similar

items, whereas in fact the similar items themselves were the main source of error (Baddeley

1968). This result has continued to present a

challenge to models of serial order.

The past decade has seen considerable activity in the attempt to produce clearly specified

computational or mathematical models of serial

order retention, with a number located within

the phonological loop tradition. Very briefly,

approaches fall into two categories. One class of

models assumes that items are associated with a

series of internal markers, which may be temporal oscillators as in Brown et al.'s (2000) OSCAR

hypothesis, or other forms of ordinal marking,

as in the case of the model and its subsequent

refinement by Burgess & Hitch (1999, 2006).

A second approach is typified by the primacy

hypothesis of Page & Norris (1998), which assumes a limited capacity of excitation that is

shared among the sequence of items. The first

item is the most strongly activated, the second

slightly less, and so forth. At recall, the strongest

item is retrieved first and then inhibited to avoid

further repetition before going on to the next

strongest. Both of these approaches can handle

the similarity sandwich effect, as they do not depend upon chaining. Furthermore, they require

two stages, a store and a serial order link, offering an interpretation of the irrelevant sound

effect in terms of adding noise to this additional

stage (Page & Norris 2003), an explanation as to

why similarity between irrelevant and remembered items is not important.

Modeling serial order continues to be a

very lively field with considerable interaction

between proponents of the different models,

which are now starting to become more ambitious. Burgess and Hitch are now attempting to

model the link between the phonological loop

and long-term phonological learning (Burgess

& Hitch 2006, Hitch et al. 2009), while a

further challenge being addressed lies in the

interpretation of chunking, the effect that

makes sentences so much more readily recalled

than scrambled words (Baddeley et al. 2009).

Can models of serial order in verbal STM be

generalized to visual STM? The answer seems

to be that they can (Hurlstone 2010). If so, do

they reflect a single common system? I myself

think it more likely that evolution has applied

the same solution to a problem, maintaining

serial order, that crops up in a range of different

domains.

The Phonological Loop and LTM

What function might the phonological loop

(PL) serve, other than making telephoning

easier (an unlikely target for Mother Nature)?

The opportunity to investigate this question

cropped up when an Italian colleague, Giuseppe

Vallar, invited me to help him to investigate

a patient, PV, with a very pure and specific

deficit in phonological STM. Her intellect was

preserved, but her auditory digit span was only

two items. She had fluent language production

and comprehension, except for long, highly

artificial sentences in which ambiguity could

only be resolved by retaining the initial part of

a long sentence until the end, again not a great

evolutionary gain. We then came up with the

idea that her phonological loop might be necessary for new long-term phonological learning.

We tested this by requiring her to learn Russian

vocabulary (e.g., flower-svieti ), comparing this

with her capacity for learning to pair unrelated

Italian words, for example (castle-table). When

compared to a group of matched controls,

her capacity to learn native language pairs was

normal, whereas she failed to learn a single

Russian word after ten successive trials, a point

at which all the normal participants had perfect

performance (Baddeley et al. 1988). We had

found a function for the phonological loop.

Although the work with PV had a major

influence on my theoretical views, of much

greater practical importance was my collaboration with Susan Gathercole, in which we explored the role of the phonological loop in vocabulary learning, both in children with specific

language impairment and in normal children. A

series of studies showed thatWM plays a significant role in the initial stages of vocabulary acquisition and is also linked to reading skills (see

10 Baddeley

Baddeley et al. 1998 for a review). It formed the

basis of an extensive and successful application

of the M-WM theory to the identification and

treatment of WM deficits in school-age children (Gathercole & Alloway 2008; Gathercole

et al. 2004a,b).

At a theoretical level, work with PV led to a

major development. I had previously tended to

treatWM and LTM as separate though interrelated systems. The fact that the loop specifically

facilitates new phonological learning implies a

direct link from the loop to LTM. Gathercole

(1995) showed that existing language habits in-

fluence immediate nonword recall, making the

nonwords that have a similar letter structure to

English, such as contramponist, easier than less

familiar sounding nonwords such as loddenapish

(Gathercole 1995). This suggests that information flows from LTM to the loop, as well as the

reverse. Furthermore, it seemed reasonable to

assume that a similar state of affairs would occur for the visuo-spatial sketchpad, leading to

a revision of the original model along the lines

indicated in Figure 2. Here, a crucial distinction is made between WM, represented by a

series of fluid systems that require only temporary activation, and LTM, representing more

permanent crystallized skills and knowledge.

Figure 2

A modification of the original model to take account

of the evidence of links between working memory

and long-term memory (LTM).

The Phonological Loop:

Master or Slave?

In formulating our model, we referred to the

loop and sketchpad as slave systems, borrowing the term from control engineering. It is,

however, becoming increasingly clear that the

loop can also provide a means of action control. In my own case, this first became obvious

during a series of studies of the CE, in this case

concentrating on its capacity for task switching. We used a very simple task in which participants were given a column of single digits

and required in one condition to add 1 and

write down a total, and in another condition,

to subtract 1, or in the switching condition, to

alternate addition and subtraction. Switching

leads to a substantial slowing, and we wanted

to know why. We used dual task methods, disrupting the CE with an attentionally demanding verbal task and a task involving simple verbal repetition. To our surprise, switching was

disrupted almost as much by articulatory suppression as by the much more demanding executive task. It became clear that people were

using a simple subvocal code of "plus-minusplus," etc., to cue their responses. When the

relevant plus and minus signs were provided on

the response sheet, the suppression effect disappeared (Baddeley et al. 2001). Similar results

have been obtained and further developed by

Emerson & Miyake (2003).

The importance of self-instruction had of

course already been beautifully demonstrated

by the great Russian psychologist Alexander

Luria, who showed that children gradually

learn to control their actions using overt selfinstruction, a process that later becomes subvocal. He went on to demonstrate the value of

self-instructions in neuropsychological rehabilitation (Luria 1959).

The Phonological Loop: Critique

The loop is probably the best-developed and

most widely investigated component of WM,

possibly because of the availability of a few

simple tools such as the phonological similarity, word length, and suppression effects. It is,

PS63CH01-Baddeley ARI 31 October 2011 10:12

however, only one very limited component of

WM. When its use in digit span is prevented

by combining visual presentation with articulatory suppression, the cost is something in the

region of two digits (Larsen & Baddeley 2003).

Its strength is that it can provide temporary sequential storage, using a process that is rapid,

and requires minimal attention. It is a system

that is extremely useful, widespread, and one

that, as experimenters, we ignore at our peril.

The analogy that comes to mind is that of the

role of the thumb in our motor behavior: small,

not essential, but very useful. There is, however, a danger of exaggerating its importance.

It appears to be this that Nairne criticized under the label "the standard hypothesis" (Nairne

2002), by which he appears to refer to attempts

to account for a range of time-specified STM

effects purely in terms of the loop. This hypothesis seemed to be attributed to myself, although

as discussed elsewhere (Baddeley 2007, pp. 35–

38), Nairne's criticisms do not apply to WM

more generally. I agree that what Nairne describes as the standard hypothesis is far from

adequate as a theory of WM or even as a general account of STM.

I have discussed the phonological loop thus

far as if it were limited to the storage of heard

and spoken speech. It is important to note, however, that the same system, operating under

broadly similar constraints, appears to underpin memory for both lip-read and signed material (see R¨onnberg et al. 2004 for a review). All

of these are language related, which raises the

question of whether the same system is used for

nonlinguistic auditory information such as environmental sounds and music. Neither of these

topics is well explored, although there is growing interest in comparing language and music and some indication of overlap (Williamson

et al. 2010).

VISUO-SPATIAL SKETCHPAD

Interest in visuo-spatial memory developed

during the 1960s, when Posner & Konick

(1966) showed that memory for a point on a line

was well retained over a period ranging up to

30 seconds, but it was disrupted by an interpolated information-processing task, suggesting

some form of active rehearsal. Dale (1973) obtained a similar result for remembering a point

located in an open field. In contrast to these spatial memory tasks, Posner & Keele (1967) produced evidence suggesting a visual store lasting

for only two seconds. However, their method

was based on speed of processing letters, in

which a visual letter code appeared to be superseded by a phonological code after two seconds.

Although this could reflect the duration of the

visual trace, it could equally well reflect a more

slowly developing phonological code that then

overrides the visual.

Visual STM

A colleague, Bill Phillips, and I decided to test

this using material that would not be readily

nameable. We chose 5 × 5 matrices in which

approximately half the cells would be filled at

random on any given trial. We tested retention

over intervals ranging from 0.3 to 9 seconds, by

presenting either an identical stimulus or one

in which a single cell was changed, with participants making a same/different judgment. We

found a steady decline over time, regardless of

whether we measured performance in terms of

accuracy or reaction time (Phillips & Baddeley

1971). A range of studies by Kroll et al. (1970),

using articulatory suppression to disrupt the use

of a name code in letter judgments, came to a

similar conclusion, that the Posner and Keele

result was based on switching from a visual to

a phonological code, perhaps because of easier

maintenance by subvocal rehearsal. Meanwhile,

Phillips went on to investigate the visual memory store using matrix stimuli, demonstrating

that accuracy declines systematically with number of cells to be remembered (Phillips 1974),

suggesting limited visual STM capacity. It was

this work that influenced our initial concept of

the visuo-spatial sketchpad.

Spatial STM

The most frequently used clinical test of visuospatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping test

(Milner 1971), which is spatially based and

involves sequential presentation and recall.

12 Baddeley

PS63CH01-Baddeley ARI 31 October 2011 10:12

The participant views an array of nine blocks

scattered across a test board. The tester taps

a sequence of blocks, and the participant

attempts to imitate this. The number of blocks

tapped is increased until performance breaks

down, with Corsi span typically being around

five, about two less than digit span. Della Sala

et al. (1999), using a modified version of the

Phillips matrix task, showed that visual pattern

span is dissociable from spatial Corsi span,

with some patients being impaired on one

while the other is preserved, and vice versa.

Furthermore, pattern span can be disrupted by

concurrent visual processing, whereas Corsi

span is more susceptible to spatial disruption (Della Sala et al. 1999). I return to the

visual-spatial distinction at a later point.

Visuo-Spatial WM

During the 1970s, research moved from visual

STM to its role in visual imagery. Our own

studies used a technique developed by Brooks

(1968), in which participants are required to remember and repeat back a sequence of spoken

sentences. In half of the cases the sentences can

be encoded as a path through a visually presented matrix. The other half of the instructions were not readily encodable spatially. We

found that recall of the visuo-spatially codable

sentences was differentially disrupted by pursuit tracking (Baddeley et al. 1975a). We interpreted this result in terms of the sketchpad,

leading to the question of whether the underlying store was visual or spatial. This we tested

using a task in which blindfolded participants

tracked a sound source (spatial but not visual)

or detected the brightening of their visual field

(visual but not spatial), again while performing

the Brooks task.We found that the tracking still

disrupted the spatial but did not interfere with

the verbal task, whereas the brightness judgment showed a slight tendency in the opposite

direction, leading us to conclude that the system was spatial rather than visual (Baddeley &

Lieberman 1980).

Although these results convinced me that

the system was essentially spatial, Robert

Logie, who was working with me at the time,

disagreed and set out to show that I was wrong.

He succeeded, demonstrating that some imagery tasks were visual rather than spatial. He

used a visual imagery mnemonic whereby two

unrelated items are associated by forming an

image of them interacting; for example, cow and

chair could be remembered as a cow sitting on a

chair. Logie (1986) showed that this process can

be disrupted by visual stimuli such as irrelevant

line drawings or indeed by simple patches of

color. There are now multiple demonstrations

of the dissociation of visual and spatial WM.

Klauer & Zhao (2004) critically review this

literature before performing a very thorough

series of investigations controlling for potential

artifacts; their results support the distinction

between visual and spatial STM, a distinction that is also supported by neuroimaging

evidence (Smith & Jonides 1997).

Yet further fractionation of the sketchpad

seems likely. Research by Smyth and colleagues

has suggested a kinesthetic or movement-based

system used in gesture and dance (Smyth &

Pendleton 1990). Another possible channel of

information into the sketchpad comes from

haptic coding as used in grasping and holding objects, which in turn is likely to involve

a tactile component. Touch itself depends on a

number of different receptor cells capable of detecting pressure, vibration, heat, cold, and pain.

We currently know very little about these aspects of STM, and my assumption that information from all of these sources converges on

the sketchpad is far from clearly established.

The nature of rehearsal in the sketchpad is

also uncertain. Logie (1995, 2011) suggests a

distinction between a "visual cache," a temporary visual store, and a spatial manipulation and

rehearsal system, the "inner scribe," although

the precise nature of visuo-spatial rehearsal remains unclear.

THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE

The Executive as Homunculus

The CE is the most complex component of

WM. Within the original model it was assumed

to be capable of attentional focus, storage, and

PS63CH01-Baddeley ARI 31 October 2011 10:12

decision making, virtually a homunculus, a little

man in the head, capable of doing all the clever

things that were outside the competence of the

two subsystems. Although our model tended

to be criticized for taking this approach, like

Attneave (1960) I regard homunculi as potentially useful if used appropriately. It is important that they are not seen as providing an explanation, but rather as a marker of issues requiring explanation. Provided the various jobs

performed by the homunculus are identified,

they can be tackled one at a time, hopefully in

due course allowing the homunculus to be pensioned off.

Much of our work has used concurrent tasks

to disrupt the various components ofWM, with

the assumption typically being that attentionally demanding tasks will place specific demands

on the CE, in contrast to tasks that require simple maintenance. For example, counting backward in threes from a number such as 271 is

assumed to load the executive, whereas simply

repeating 271 would not. This and related tasks

have proved to be a successful strategy for separating out contributions of the three initially

proposed WM subcomponents (e.g., Baddeley

et al. 2011).

Fractionating the Executive

In an attempt to specify the functions of the

CE, I speculated as to what these might be;

what would any adequate executive need to be

able to do? I came up with four suggestions

(Baddeley 1996). First it would need to be able

to focus attention; evidence of this came from

the impact of reducing attention on complex

tasks such as chess (Robbins et al. 1996). A second desirable characteristic would be the capacity to divide attention between two important

targets or stimulus streams. I had been studying this in collaboration with Italian colleagues

for a number of years, focusing on Alzheimer's

disease. We selected two tasks involving separate modalities: one verbal, involving recall of

digit sequences, and the other requiring visuospatial tracking. We titrated the level of diffi-

culty for each of these to a point at which our patients were performing at the same level as both

young and elderly controls. We then required

tracking and digit recall to operate simultaneously. There was a marked deficit in the performance of the patients when compared to either

of the two control groups. Perhaps surprisingly,

age did not disrupt this specific executive capacity, provided the level of difficulty is equated in

the first place (Logie et al. 2004). In the absence of titration of level of difficulty, however,

performance tends to decline with age on the

tasks when performed singly, with the deficit

even greater when the two tasks are performed

at the same time (Riby et al. 2004).

The third executive capacity we investigated

involved switching between tasks, for which we

felt there might be a specific control system.

As mentioned earlier, we chose to study a task

involving alternating between simple addition

and subtraction, using a demanding concurrent

verbal executive task and articulatory suppression as its nondemanding equivalent. We

found a large effect of articulatory suppression

coupled with a rather small additional effect

when an executive load accompanied suppression. The study of task switching has expanded

very substantially in recent years (Monsell

2005), becoming theoretically rather complex,

and in my view at least, arguing against a

unitary executive capacity for task switching.

I should point out that there are many other

suggestions as to the basic set of executive

capacities that are too numerous to discuss in

this context (see, for example, Engle & Kane

2004, Miyake et al. 2000, Shallice 2002).

Interfacing with LTM

The fourth executive task that I assigned to

our homunculus was the capacity to interface

with LTM. In an attempt to constrain our

WM model, we had made the assumption

that the CE was a purely attentional system

with no storage capacity (Baddeley & Logie

1999). However, this created a number of

problems. One concerned the question of

how subsystems using different codes could

be integrated without some form of common

storage. Participants do not simply use either

one code or another, but rather combine them,

14 Baddeley

PS63CH01-Baddeley ARI 31 October 2011 10:12

with both visual and phonological codes being

usable simultaneously (Logie et al. 2000).

This capacity is particularly marked in the

case of language processing, where a single

phrase can show the influence of phonological

coding at short delays and semantic coding

at longer intervals (Baddeley & Ecob 1970).

Memory span for unrelated words is around

5, increasing to 15 when the words make up

a sentence. This enhanced span for sentencebased sequences seems to reflect an interaction

between phonological and semantic systems

rather than a simple additive effect (Baddeley

et al. 1987), a conclusion that is consistent with

later dual-task studies (Baddeley et al. 2009).

But how might this interaction occur?

A further challenge to the concept of a

purely attentional executive came from the

very extensive work on individual differences in

WM stemming from the initial demonstration

by Daneman & Carpenter (1980) of a correlation between a measure they termed "WM

span" and capacity for prose comprehension.

Their measure required participants to read

out a sequence of sentences and then recall the

final word of each. This and similar tests that

require the combination of temporary storage

and processing have proved enormously successful in predicting performance on cognitive

tasks ranging from comprehension to complex

reasoning and from learning a programming

language to resisting distraction (see Daneman

& Merikle 1996 and Engle et al. 1999 for

reviews). Such results were gratifying in

demonstrating the practical significance of

WM, but embarrassing for a model that had

no potential for storage other than the limited

capacities of the visuo-spatial and phonological

subsystems. In response to these and related

issues, I decided to add a fourth component,

the episodic buffer (Baddeley 2000). Although

I was reluctant to add further systems to the

multicomponent theory, I felt that one in

25 years was perhaps acceptable.

THE EPISODIC BUFFER

The characteristics of the new system are

indicated by its name; it is episodic in that

it is assumed to hold integrated episodes or

chunks in a multidimensional code. In doing

so, it acts as a buffer store, not only between

the components of WM, but also linking

WM to perception and LTM. It is able to

do this because it can hold multidimensional

representations, but like most buffer stores it

has a limited capacity. On this point we agree

with Cowan (2005) in assuming a capacity in

the region of four chunks. I made the further

assumption that retrieval from the buffer occurred through conscious awareness, providing

a link with our earlier research on the vividness

of visual and auditory imagery (Baddeley &

Andrade 2000). This results in a theory of

consciousness that resembles that proposed by

Baars (1988), which assumes that consciousness

serves as a mechanism for binding stimulus

features into perceived objects. He uses the

metaphor of a stage on which the products

of preconscious processes, the actors, become

available to conscious awareness, the audience.

Our new component could be regarded as a

fractionation of our initial 1974 version of the

CE into separate attentional and storage systems. It had a number of advantages in addition

to providing a possible answer to the question

of the interaction between LTM and WM. At a

theoretical level it formed a bridge between our

own bottom-up approach based on attempting

to understand the peripheral systems first, and

the more top-down approaches predominant

in North America, which were more concerned

with analyzing the executive and attentional

aspects of WM (e.g., Cowan 2005, Engle

et al. 1999). Perhaps for this reason, the

concept appears to have been welcomed and

is frequently cited. However, although that

suggests that people find it useful, if it is to be

theoretically productive, there is a need to use

it to ask interesting and tractable questions,

a challenge that has kept Graham Hitch,

Richard Allen, and myself busy over recent

years.

WM and Binding

Like Baars (1988), we assume that a central role

of the buffer is to provide a multidimensional

medium that allows features from different

sources to be bound into chunks or episodes,

not only perceptually but also creatively, allowing us to imagine something new, for example,

an ice-hockey-playing elephant. We could

then reflect on this new concept and decide,

for example, whether our elephant would be

better doing a mean defensive body check or

keeping goal. This all seemed likely to be an

attention-demanding process, so we speculated

that the buffer would depend heavily on the

CE. In the initial (Baddeley 2000) model (see

Figure 3), I intentionally required all access

to go through the executive, arguing that we

could then investigate empirically whether

other links were needed.

We studied the role in binding played by

each of the three initial components of WM,

using our well-tried concurrent task strategy to

disrupt each in turn. If, as our initial hypothesis proposed, the CE controls access to and

from the buffer, then an attentionally demanding concurrent task should have a very substantial effect on the capacity to bind information,

in contrast to minor effects from disrupting the

other subsystems.We decided to examine binding in two very different modalities, namely the

binding of visual features into perceived objects

on one hand, and the binding of words into sentences on the other.

Visual Binding and WM

Our work on visual binding was strongly in-

fluenced by some new developments that were

beginning to extend the methods applied to

the study of visual attention to the subsequent

short-term storage of perceived items. A central

question of this approach concerned the factors that determine the conditions under which

features such as color and shape are integrated

and bound into perceived and remembered objects. The basic experimental paradigm was developed by Luck & Vogel (1997, Vogel et al.

2001). As in the work of Phillips (1974), it involved presenting an array of visual stimuli, followed (after a brief delay) by a probe stimulus,

with participants deciding whether or not the

probe had been in the array. A number of important results emerged, notably including the

observation that capacity was limited to about

four objects and was approximately the same,

regardless of whether participants were remembering only a single feature, for example, color

or shape, or were required to bind the two features and remember not only that a red stimulus had been presented, or a square, but also

that the two had been bound together as a red

square (Vogel et al. 2001). A subsequent study

by Wheeler & Treisman (2002) obtained the

same result when testing involved a single probe

item. However, they found a binding impairment when the memory test required searching through an array of stimuli in order to find

a target match, a result they interpreted as suggesting that maintaining the binding of features

was attentionally demanding.

We ourselves tested the attentional hypothesis using our concurrent task procedure.

Presentation of the stimulus array was accompanied by a demanding task such as counting

backward by threes. If the CE is heavily involved in binding, then the concurrent task

should prove more detrimental to the binding condition (e.g., remembering a red square)

than to either of the single-feature probe tasks

(e.g., red or square). We compared the backward counting condition to one involving articulatory suppression. As expected, we found

an overall impairment in performance when

accompanied by backward counting. However,

this was just as great for the single features as

for the binding condition.

A series of further studies explored this

finding, using other concurrent tasks and more

demanding binding conditions. In one case,

for example, shapes and the color patches

to which each shape should be bound were

presented in separate locations. In another

study, the features to be bound were separated

in time, while a third experiment presented

one feature visually (e.g., a patch of red) and

the associated shape verbally. Although some

of these activities led to a lower overall level

of performance, in no case did we obtain a

differential disruption of binding (see Baddeley

et al. 2011 for a review).

The final experiment of the Allen et al.

(2006) paper did, however, obtain a differential effect. In this study, colored shapes were

presented sequentially, followed by a probe.

When the final item was probed, the results

were as before: no additional binding deficit.

However, earlier items did show poorer retention of bound stimuli. We interpreted this as

suggesting that binding did not demand extra

attention but that maintaining it against distraction did. We explored this disruption effect

further, again using simultaneous presentation,

but this time inserting a single additional item

that participants were instructed to ignore between presentation and test. Binding was differentially impaired even though participants were

told to ignore the suffix, which suggests that although visual binding per se is not attention demanding, maintaining bindings against distraction is (see Baddeley et al. 2011 for an overview).

Binding in Verbal WM

Although it appears that attention may be useful

for maintaining visual bindings, our data indicate that the simple binding of color and shape

is not itself attention demanding. It could, of

course, be argued that perceptual binding is

atypical in not requiring central resources. Fortunately, however, as part of our converging operations approach to theory, we had pursued a

parallel series of experiments investigating the

role of executive processes in the binding of

words into chunks during retention of spoken

sentences.

We carried out a series of experiments, the

results of which can be summarized quite simply

(Baddeley et al. 2009). Concurrent tasks involving the visuo-spatial sketchpad had a small but

significant effect on recall that increased when

they also had a visually based executive component. Simple articulatory suppression had a

greater effect that was further amplified when

both suppression and attentional load were required. Most importantly, however, none of

these tasks differentially disrupted the binding

of words into chunks as reflected in magnitude

of the advantage in recalling sentences over unrelated word sequences. Hence, just as with visual binding, although concurrent tasks impair

overall performance, they do not appear to interfere with the binding process itself, which in

the case of sentences, we assume operates relatively automatically in LTM.

The evidence from both visual and verbal

binding is thus inconsistent with the original

proposal that the process of binding involves

the active manipulation of information within

the episodic buffer, which we now regard as being an important but essentially passive structure on which bindings achieved elsewhere can

be displayed. It remains important in that it allows executive processes to carry out further

manipulation. This may in turn lead to further

bindings involving, for example, the binding of

phrases into integrated sentences or objects into

complex scenes.

In conclusion, although binding is sometimes discussed as if it were a unitary function, we suggest that it differs depending on

the specific type of binding involved. For example, binding may be perceptual or linguistic,

and it may be temporary, as required to perform WM tasks, or durable, as in the binding

of new information to its context in LTM, a

capacity that is disrupted in amnesic patients,

who may nonetheless show normal binding

in WM (Baddeley et al. 2010). All of these

types of binding may, however, result in bound

representations accessible through the episodic

buffer.

LINKING LONG-TERM AND

WORKING MEMORY

Is WM Just Activated LTM?

A number of approaches describe WM as activated LTM (e.g., Cowan 2005, Ruchkin et al.

2003). My view on this issue is that working

memory involves the activation of many areas

of the brain that involve LTM. This is also true

of language, for which activated LTM is not

taken as an explanation. I assume that in the

case of Cowan's (2005) model, it is a way of referring to those aspects of WM that are not his

current principal concern and not a denial of a

need for further explanation. He and I would,

I think, agree that the phonological loop, the

simplest component of WM, is likely to depend on phonological and lexical representations within LTM as well as procedurally based

language habits for rehearsal.

Long-Term WM

Ericsson & Kintsch (1995) proposed this concept in explaining the superior performance of

Figure 4

My current view of the complex and multiple links between working memory

(WM) and long-term memory (LTM).

expert mnemonists, going on to extend it to

the use of semantic and linguistic knowledge to

boost memory performance. They argue that

these and other situations utilize previously developed structures in LTM as a means of boosting WM performance. I agree, but I cannot see

any advantage in treating this as a different kind

of WM rather than a particularly clear example

of the way in which WM and LTM interact.

LTM and the Multicomponent Model

It seems likely that some of the misunderstandings confronting M-WM stem from the rather

limited links with LTM shown inFigures 2 and

3. This was also reflected in a disagreement between myself and Robert Logie, who insisted

that all information entered the sketchpad via

LTM. It was only when I tried to represent my

views in the simple model shown in Figure 4

that we found we agreed. Incoming information

is processed by systems that themselves are in-

fluenced by LTM. I seeWM as a complex interactive system that is able to provide an interface

between cognition and action, an interface that

is capable of handling information in a range of

modalities and stages of processing.

NEUROBIOLOGICAL

APPROACHES TO

WORKING MEMORY

The development of my own views on WM

has been strongly influenced by the study

of patients with neuropsychological deficits,

and particularly by patients with specific impairment in the absence of general cognitive

deficits. Brain damage can be seen scientifi-

cally as producing a series of unfortunate experiments of nature. Nature is not usually a good

experimenter: Patients typically have a range of

different deficits, but just occasionally "pure"

deficits occur that potentially, given careful and

thorough investigation, allow clear theoretical

conclusions to be drawn. These can then be extended to help diagnose and treat patients with

related but more complex disabilities.

There are two aspects of such research:

the behavioral, linking the performance of

18 Baddeley

PS63CH01-Baddeley ARI 31 October 2011 10:12

the patient to cognitive psychology, and the

neurobiological, linking it to its anatomical and

neurophysiological basis. Both are important

and will ultimately be combined. However,

my own expertise and current concern is

for the behavioral and the extent to which

neurobiological research has so far contributed

to the cognitive understanding of M-WM.

There is no doubt that the popularity of the

concept of WM owes a great deal to neurobiological studies that appear to suggest that WM

may depend on one or more specific anatomical

locations. Single-unit recording of the brains

of awake monkeys performing a visual STM

task found that continued activation of cells in

the frontal cortex was associated with successful recall, and disrupted activation was associated with failure (Goldman-Rakic 1988). This

led some to conclude that it reflected a specific frontal location of WM. My own view was

that it probably formed part of a complex circuit underpinning the visuo-spatial sketchpad.

Subsequent discovery of similar cells elsewhere

in the brain is consistent with this view.

A second source of apparent support for the

concept ofWM came from neuroimaging when

the various subsystems of M-WM appeared to

be relatively closely localizable (for reviews, see

Henson 2001, Smith & Jonides 1997). This led

to a large number of further neuroimaging investigations from many different laboratories,

producing a range of different results, which

when fed into a meta-analysis often failed to

show a consistent pattern (see Baddeley 2007,

chapter 7). My own view is that this simply

reflects the unreliability of such results and

the complexity of WM, as well as the need to

modify paradigms to fit the constraints of neuroimaging, for example, avoiding overt speech.

A different interpretation is offered by

Jonides et al. (2008), who comment on the

"near-revolutionary changes in psychological

theories about STM, with similarly great advances in the neurosciences" that have occurred

in the past decade. Their very ambitious interpretation of the "mind and brain of STM"

is discussed below. More generally, although

I think it is very important to understand the

neurobiological basis of WM, I am not yet convinced that it has made a major contribution

to psychological theories of WM. This does

not reflect a general rejection of neuroimaging,

which offers an essential and potentially powerful tool for understanding cognition and its

neural basis. There are some important areas,

such as those investigating conscious awareness,

in which neuroimaging provides a crucial component in testing and potentially validating distinctions such as that between "remembering"

and "knowing" (D¨uzel et al. 2001). In the case

of WM, however, I have two major sources of

doubt. The first concerns the lack of apparent

replicability in the field. The second more basic concern is the validity of the assumption that

anatomical localization will provide a firm theoretical basis for a system as complex as WM

in the absence of a much better understanding

of the temporal structure of activation than is

typically available at present.

SOME ALTERNATIVE

APPROACHES

Theories of STM

A good deal of the controversy surrounding

M-WM concerns those aspects associated with

STM rather than WM, and in particular with

the phonological loop model. Whereas some

are concerned with the specifics of the model,

such as trace decay, for example, other concerns

stem from a difference in purpose. Much of our

own work has focused on analyzing one source

of short-term storage, that based on phonological coding. That means using tasks that minimize semantic and other longer-term factors.

Other theorists focus on the whole range of

codes that may be contributing, as in the case

of Nairne's (1990) feature model. These will

inevitably include long-term factors such as semantic coding and will emphasize the similarities between STM and LTM. I regard these

two approaches as complementary.

Theories of WM

There are a number of ambitious models of

WM that I regard as broadly consistent with

PS63CH01-Baddeley ARI 31 October 2011 10:12

the multicomponent framework, although each

has a different emphasis and terminology.

Cowan's Embedded Processes Theory

Cowan defines WM as "cognitive processes

that are maintained in an unusually accessible

state" (Cowan 1999, p. 62). His theory involves

a limited-capacity attentional focus that operates across areas of activated LTM. A central

issue for Cowan over recent years has been to

specify the capacity of this attentional focus and

hence the capacity of WM. He produces extensive evidence to suggest that, unlike an earlier

suggestion of seven items, the capacity is much

closer to four. Importantly, however, this is four

chunks or episodes, each of which may contain

more than a single item (Cowan 2005).

At a superficial level, Cowan's theories

might seem to be totally different from my

own. In practice, however, we agree on most

issues but differ in our terminology and areas

of current focus. I see Cowan's model as principally concerned, in my terminology, with the

link between the CE and the episodic buffer.

Cowan refers to the material on which his system works as "activated LTM" but does not

treat this as providing an adequate explanation,

accepting the need for a more detailed analysis

of the processes operating beyond attentional

focus as reflected in his extensive and influential work on verbal STM, research that interacts

with and is complementary to the phonological

loop hypothesis of verbal STM (e.g., Cowan

et al. 1992). I regard our differences as principally ones of emphasis and terminology.

Individual Difference–Based Theories

The demonstration by Daneman & Carpenter

(1980) that WM-span measures can predict

comprehension has provided a major focus of

research on WM over the past 30 years, involving multiple replications and extensions

(Daneman & Merikle 1996). At a theoretical level, there has been considerable interest in identifying the feature of such complex span measures that allows them to predict

cognitive performance so effectively. Purely

correlational approaches to this issue have

a number of limitations, and in my view,

the most promising work in this area comes

from combining experimental and correlational methods to tackle the question of why

some people are better able to sustain material under these complex conditions. Some

explanations focus on the capacity to utilize

gaps between the processing operations of

the span task in order to maintain a fading

memory trace (Barrouillet et al. 2004). Others

also assume the need to resist time-based decay

but emphasize efficiency at switching between

the various tasks involved in span (Towse et al.

2000) or they emphasize the role of interference

rather than decay (Saito & Miyake 2004).

However, the most extensively developed

theoretical account of the mechanisms underpinningWM capacity is that proposed by Engle

and colleagues (Engle et al. 1999, Engle & Kane

2004). They emphasize the importance of inhibitory processes, which they argue are crucial

to shielding the memory content from potential disruption. Much of their work involves a

combination of individual difference and experimental approaches, typically initially testing a

large group of participants and then selecting

two subgroups, those with very high and those

with very low WM span. They have demonstrated that such groups differ not only in WM

performance but also in susceptibility to interference across tasks ranging from recall from

episodic LTM, through the capacity to generate items from a semantic category, to performance on an antisaccade task of eye movement

control (for a review, see Engle & Kane 2004).

Although this is an impressive program of work,

I suspect that a theory of executive processing

based entirely on inhibitory control may be a

little narrow. Control is clearly important, but

I suspect people also differ in more positive aspects of attentional capacity.

In general, I would see most of the models

of WM based on individual differences as

consistent with the broad M-WM framework

typically focusing on executive control but

accepting the contribution of separate visual

and verbal STM components (see Alloway

20 Baddeley

et al. 2006 for an example of such a model).

Once again, overall similarities may be obscured by terminological differences. Engle

and colleagues (Unsworth & Engle 2007) have

recently reverted to an earlier distinction between primary and secondary memory, which

I would interpret in terms of the distinction

between the fluid and crystallized systems that

reflect temporary structural representations in

the M-WM model (see Figure 2).

Jonides and the Mind

and Brain of STM

This approach ( Jonides et al. 2008) is strongly

influenced by neuroimaging in assuming, for

each of a range of modalities, that perception,

STM, and LTM are all performed in the same

anatomical locations. They also cite evidence

from neuropsychology, suggesting that amnesic

patients have a general difficulty in binding features together (Hannula et al. 2006, Olson et al.

2006). However, this evidence has been criticized on two grounds: first, that the measures

used comprise both long- and short-term components (Shrager et al. 2008), and second, that

the conclusions are based on spatial binding.

There is strong evidence that both spatial processing and episodic LTM depend on the hippocampus. Nonspatial binding such as that of

color to shape was not found to be impaired

in a hippocampally compromised amnesic patient (Baddeley et al. 2010), whereas classic amnesic patients do not appear to show evidence

of aWM deficit (Baddeley &Warrington 1970,

Squire 2004). Furthermore, developmental amnesic patient Jon, who has greatly reduced hippocampal volume, performs well on a range of

complex WM tasks (Baddeley et al. 2011).

The major source of evidence cited by

Jonides et al. comes from neuroimaging, where

STM tasks often activate areas of the brain

that also are involved in LTM (e.g., Ruchkin

et al. 2003). However, as Jonides et al. note

in their discussion of the single-unit studies,

the fact that an area becomes active during a

given task does not mean that it is essential

for performance on that task. Presenting a

word is likely to activate regions responsible

for its phonological, articulatory, lexical, and

semantic dimensions, but that does not mean

that all these are necessary in order to repeat

that word. Potentially more powerful evidence

exists based on lesions in neuropsychological

patients (Olson et al. 2006), but the interpretation of this has been questioned (Baddeley

et al. 2010); the classic neuropsychological literature typically reports a dissociation between

perceptual and memory deficits (Shallice 1988).

The "mind and brain" model proposed by

Jonides et al. is somewhat complex, involving

five psychological assumptions and six assumptions about neurobiological processing levels.

They go on to illustrate their model, using

the case of remembering three visual items

over a two-second delay, resulting in a figure

that involves 13 psychological processes operating across 10 neural levels. I remain somewhat

skeptical as to how productive such a model will

prove to be. This reflects a difference between

us in theoretical style, with my own preference

for the gradual development of detailed modes

within a broad theoretical framework, whereas

Jonides et al. are rather more ambitious.

Computational Models of WM

The WM theorists discussed so far have

all taken a broad-based approach to theory.

There are, however, theorists who attempt a

much more detailed account of WM, typically

accompanied by computer simulation. This is

a very flexible approach, giving rise to a range

of different models of WM, which can on

occasion result in subcomponents resembling

aspects of M-WM including the sketch pad

(Anderson et al. 2004, p. 1037) and the loop

(Anderson et al. 1996).

Barnard's (1985) ambitious computationally based "interacting cognitive subsystems"

model can also be mapped directly onto MWM. It was initially developed to account for

language processing but was subsequently used

extensively by Barnard to analyze situations involving human–computer interaction (Barnard

1987). The model can simulate most aspects

of WM while linking it to motor control,

emotion, and levels of awareness as part of a

broad, ambitious, and insightful model, which

in Barnard's hands has been applied with

success to an impressive range of situations

from choreography to theories of depression

(Teasdale & Barnard 1993). However, the

sheer complexity of the model makes it difficult

for others to use. It is also unclear how important the computational detail really is, and

indeed whether it gives an adequate account of

what is happening within the more peripheral

subcomponents. In discussing his attempt to

produce a full simulation of the model, Howard

Bowman (2011), a computer scientist who had

worked with Barnard in a simulation, now

advocates a hierarchical decomposition of the

model using components that can be built in

isolation, avoiding unnecessary detail such as

premature attempts to specify at a neural level.

I suspect that undue complexity may in

due course also prove to be a problem for an

ambitious new model proposed by Oberauer

(2010), who attempts to provide a blueprint

for the whole WM system. He sees the main

focus of WM as being "to serve as a blackboard

for information processing on which we can

construct new representations with little

interference from old memories." He proposes

six requirements for a WM system, namely,

(a) maintaining structural representations by

dynamic bindings, (b) manipulating them,

(c) flexibly reconfiguring them, (d ) partially

decoupling these from LTM, (e) controlling

LTM retrieval, and ( f ) encoding new structures into LTM. He postulates mechanisms

for achieving each of these, hence attempting

to put flesh on the previously vague concept of

"activated LTM."

A crucial feature of Oberauer's model is the

distinction he makes between declarative and

procedural WM. Declarative WM is the aspect

ofWM of which we are aware, comprising most

of the current work in the area, whereas proceduralWM is concerned with the nondeclarative

processes that underpin such operations: I assume that an example would be the process controlling subvocal rehearsal. However, he also

considers a higher level of procedural control

through what he refers to as the "bridge," as in

the bridge of a ship, and what I myself would call

the central executive. Consider the following:

A participant in my experiment is instructed to

press the red button when the number 1 appears, press the green for number 2, and neither

for 3. We would expect this simple instruction

to be followed throughout the experiment. It

is as if some mini-program is set up and then

runs, but we currently know very little about

how this is achieved. I think the investigation

of this aspect of procedural working memory,

sometimes referred to as "task set," will become

increasingly influential.

This is certainly a very ambitious program,

and as Oberauer points out, the evidence at

present is rather sparse, but it could be an exciting development. However, the sheer complexity of the model may make it difficult to

evaluate experimentally. But then, I am a theoretical mapmaker and temperamentally skeptical of complex theoretical architectures. Time

will tell.

WHAT NEXT?

A Speculative Model

and Some Questions

I have described my attempts to turn a broad

theoretical framework into a more detailed

model by a process of speculation followed by

empirical exploration. It is therefore perhaps

appropriate to end on my own current speculations and some of the many questions they raise.

As Figure 5 shows, my current views are not

dramatically different from our original speculation, apart from the episodic buffer, and the

attempt to provide considerably more speculative detail. In each case this suggests questions

that will not be easily answered but that potentially offer a way forward. I consider the various

components in turn.

Central executive. This is an attentional system; how does it differ from the limitedcapacity component of Cowan's (2005) model?

capacity? To what extent is this limited by number of chunks and to what extent by similarity between chunks? If similarity is important,

taste? How is rehearsal maintained? My current speculation is that it operates according

to the principle of attentionally based refreshing, as discussed by Johnson et al. (2002). What

have suggested that it impacts WM via a hedonic detector system; where within the M-WM

system is this located?

I assume that the buffer provides access to

conscious awareness; does this mean that we are

not directly aware of the other subsystems but

only of their products when registered in the

buffer?

Phonological loop. Can we reach a conclusion on the ancient trace decay/interference

controversy? Is subvocal rehearsal atypical of

other types of rehearsal, as I suspect? To what

extent is the loop used for remembering nonverbal material such as music or environmental

sounds?

Visuo-spatial sketchpad. The visual and spatial aspects appear to be clearly separable but

linked within the sketchpad; is this true of haptic, tactile, and kinesthetic memory? What is

the mechanism of visuo-spatial rehearsal? Is it

a spatial analogue to the phonological loop, as

Logie (1995) suggests, or is it more like attentionally based refreshing? Finally, given that

our attempt to link the loop with LTM through

language acquisition proved very fruitful, would

pursuing the link between the sketchpad and

LTM prove equally useful?

Integration

Finally, how do these increasingly detailed

accounts fit together to provide an interactive

unitary system that mediates between perception, LTM, and action?

In Praise of Negative Results

It is of course very easy to raise questions, but

much more difficult to answer them. This can

lead to a program that cautiously seeks easy

confirmation of what we are pretty sure we already know, resulting in confirmation bias, and

an avoidance of too much risk of negative results. Negative results are a pain for a number of

reasons. First of all, they are hard to interpret.

They could result from a poor design or sloppy

experimentation. They also raise the question

of whether the experiment has sufficient power

and indeed whether the question is worth asking in the first place, with all these factors making negative results harder to publish. If we are

to understand WM, however, it is important to

know what it does not do, and this is likely

to involve negative results, as has often proved

to be the case in the various stages of developing the current M-WM model. Publication

is justifiably more difficult, and there needs to

be a good justification for the question. Negative results can, however, be very important and

publishable, provided the problem of sensitivity is addressed through inclusion of other conditions showing positive effects together with

clear evidence of replication. This was the case

with our original 1974 studies, where the effect of concurrent tasks was much less than

anticipated, and even more so in our recent exploration of the episodic buffer (Baddeley et al.

2009, 2011).

So what does WM not do? My own conclusion after surveying the experimental literature

and its implications for clinical and social psychology (Baddeley 2007) is that we have evolved

an overall cognitive system that attempts to

minimize the demands made on WM while allowing it to intervene where necessary. A very

basic example is that of breathing, far too important to be left to working memory. However, as any diver or singer will know, we clearly

do have considerable, though limited, control.

Suicide by breath holding is not an option.

Applications

A central requirement of our original framework was that it should be applicable outside the laboratory. Although I have not discussed this aspect of M-WM, it does appear

to have had success in achieving this, at two

levels. First, through direct application of the

M-WM framework to specific practical problems, Gathercole's extensive development of a

WM measure applied to school-aged children

has been successful in identifying children at

risk and providing methods of helping teachers

identify and help children with WM problems

(Gathercole & Alloway 2008). Another instance

is the development and validation of a dual-task

performance measure for the early detection of

Alzheimer's disease (Kaschel et al. 2009, Logie

et al. 2004).

A second aspect of theoretical application

is the use of the M-WM theory as a tool for

investigating and understanding other research

areas. Here the applications are very extensive,

ranging from human factors to psychiatry,

neuropharmacology to language therapy,

and even to paleoanthropology, where the

development of working memory is proposed

as an explanation of the differences between

Neanderthal man and homo sapiens, suggested

by a study of surviving artifacts (Wynn &

Coolidge 2010).

My own view is that this breadth of application has reflected the simplicity of the theoretical framework together with the availability

of a few basic methodologies, such as the use

of similarity effects as an indication of coding

dimension and of dual-task performance as a

way of controlling processing. Such techniques

are easily learned, and while not guaranteeing

fruitful answers, do at least provide conceptual and practical tools for investigating a

wide range of problems. From a theoretical

viewpoint, such practical applications can be

extremely valuable both in helping explore

the boundaries of the laboratory-based effects

and in highlighting theoretical anomalies that

have the potential to become future growing

points.

CONCLUSION

So where does this leave our early question of

what makes a good theory? Clearly, my own

preference has been for Toulmin's view of theories as maps, coupled with the Lakatos criterion of judging success by productiveness rather

than predictive accuracy. However, as we begin

to fill in the empty spaces on the theoretical

map, it hopefully will be increasingly possible

to develop interlinked and more detailed models of the components of WM and their mode

of interaction.
