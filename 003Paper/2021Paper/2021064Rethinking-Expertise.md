Fredrik Ullén, David Zachary Hambrick, and Miriam Anna Mosing Online First Publication, December 21, 2015

### Abstract

Scientific interest in expertise—superior performance within a specific domain—has a long history in psychology. Although there is a broad consensus that a long period of practice is essential for expertise, a long-standing controversy in the field concerns the importance of other variables such as cognitive abilities and genetic factors. According to the influential deliberate practice theory, expert performance is essentially limited by a single variable: the amount of deliberate practice an individual has accumulated. Here, we provide a review of the literature on deliberate practice, expert performance, and its neural correlates. A particular emphasis is on recent studies indicating that expertise is related to numerous traits other than practice as well as genetic factors. We argue that deliberate practice theory is unable to account for major recent findings relating to expertise and expert performance, and propose an alternative multifactorial gene–environment interaction model of expertise, which provides an adequate explanation for the available empirical data and may serve as a useful framework for future empirical and theoretical work on expert performance.

心理学界对于专家水平 —— 即在特定领域内展现出的卓越能力 —— 的研究兴趣源远流长。虽然人们普遍认同，长期的刻意练习对于达成专家水平至关重要，但关于认知能力和遗传因素等其他因素的重要性，学界一直存在争议。根据颇具影响力的刻意练习理论，达到专家级表现的关键基本上取决于一个因素：个人累积的刻意练习时间。本文综述了有关刻意练习、专家表现及其神经机制的研究文献，特别指出，近期研究显示，达到专家水平不仅与练习有关，还与多种特质和遗传因素相关。我们认为，刻意练习理论未能充分解释近期关于专家水平和专家表现的关键发现，并提出了一种新的解释模型 —— 多因素基因-环境互动专家模型。这一模型充分考虑了遗传和环境因素的相互作用，为解释现有的实证数据提供了充分的理论基础，为未来的实证研究和理论发展提供了一个实用的框架。

Learning and neural plasticity are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, but the learning capacity of humans appears remarkable compared with most other animals. One reason for this is that humans can engage in both practice—persistent, goal-directed activities designed to increase knowledge and skills—and teaching, the active training of learners by more experienced individuals (Premack, 2007). Together, practice and teaching enable individuals to gradually acquire highly specialized competencies, which are needed for achieving consistently superior levels of performance within a particular domain, that is, to become experts. The variety of different forms of vocational and avocational expertise across cultures is further testament to the flexibility of human learning. On domain-specific tasks, the performance differences between experts and nonexperts can be massive (Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996), from both a statistical and a practical perspective. A striking feature of human societies is thus not just a complex division of labor but also a vast range of interindividual variability in skills and abilities.

学习和神经的可塑性是动物世界普遍存在的现象，但人类的学习能力与大部分其他动物相比显得尤为突出。这背后的一个原因在于，人类不仅可以通过持续且有目标的活动来提高自己的知识和技能，也就是我们说的「练习」，还能通过更有经验的人主动进行「教学」，来训练学习者。这两者的结合，使得个体能够逐步掌握高度专业化的技能，达到某一领域内持续优秀的表现，也就是成为那个领域的专家。不同文化中存在的职业和爱好专长的多样性，进一步展示了人类学习的灵活性。专家与非专家在特定领域任务的表现之间可能存在巨大的差异（如 Ericsson 和 Lehmann 在 1996 年的研究所示），这种差异不仅在统计上意义重大，实际应用中也极为重要。因此，人类社会的一个显著特征不只是劳动分工的复杂性，还有个体间技能和能力的广泛差异。

Scientific interest in expertise and related topics has a long history. Indeed, psychologists have been interested in the origins of expertise for as long as psychology has been a field. A longstanding controversy in the area concerns the relative importance of nature and nurture for achievement and expertise. In the late 1800s, Francis Galton (1869) analyzed family trees of eminent scientists, musicians, writers, and other professionals, and noted that accomplishment tends to run in families. Based on these observations, Galton concluded that “natural ability” is important for eminence and achievement. More than half a century later, the behaviorist John Watson famously articulated the alternative environmental view when he speculated that, in a hypothetical scenario in which the environment is completely controlled, he could take any infant at random and train him to become “any type of specialist . . . regardless of his talents” (Watson, 1998/1924, p. 82).

对专业知识及其相关议题的科学研究追溯有着长久的历史。实际上，自心理学成为一门独立学科以来，心理学家就对专业知识的根源抱有浓厚的兴趣。其中一个历久不衰的争论焦点是天性与后天培养在人的成就和专业知识形成中的相对重要性。19 世纪末，弗朗西斯·高尔顿通过分析杰出的科学家、音乐家、作家以及其他专业人士的家族史，发现优秀成就往往在家庭中有所传承。基于这些观察，高尔顿得出结论，认为「天赋能力」对于卓越成就至关重要。超过半个世纪后，行为主义心理学家约翰·沃森提出了一种截然不同的观点，他通过一个假设的完全可控环境情景，声称自己能够将任意婴儿培养成「任何类型的专家」，无论他的天赋如何（沃森，1998/1924，第 82 页）。

More recently, scientists from a number of different research traditions have used a wide variety of methods and approaches to study the origins and underpinnings of expertise, ranging from historiometric and biographical studies of high-achieving individuals, to sociological, psychological, computational, and neurobiological studies of exceptional performance and its mechanisms (Ericsson, Charness, Feltovich, & Hoffman, 2006; Ericsson & Smith, 1991; Eysenck, 1995; Galton, 1869; Gardner, 1993; Gobet, DeVoogt, & Retschitzki, 2004; Howe, Davidson, & Sloboda, 1998; Simonton, 2004; Sternberg & Grigorenko, 2003; Terman, 1925).

近年来，不同研究传统的科学家们采用了广泛的方法和手段来探索专业知识的起源及其基础，这些研究方法包括对高成就个体进行历史计量学和传记学研究，以及利用社会学、心理学、计算学和神经生物学的方法研究卓越表现及其机制，涉及的研究者包括埃里克森、查内斯、费尔托维奇、霍夫曼（2006 年），以及艾森克（1995 年）、高尔顿（1869 年）、加德纳（1993 年）、戈贝特、德沃格特、雷特希茨基（2004 年）、豪、戴维森、斯洛博达（1998 年）、西蒙顿（2004 年）、斯特恩伯格与格里戈连科（2003 年）、特曼（1925 年）等人的工作。

A paradigm that has been particularly influential in psychological research on expertise over the past two decades is the expert performance framework developed in particular by Ericsson and colleagues (Ericsson & Smith, 1991; Ericsson & Ward, 2007; Feltovich, Prietula, & Ericsson, 2006). The expert performance framework emphasizes the importance of studying expert performance using objective measures of performance on standardized, representative tasks rather than more indirect indices of expertise, such as estimates by raters, credentials, or educational level (Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996; Ericsson & Ward, 2007). The roots of this research tradition can be traced back to early studies of complex skill learning (Bryan & Harter, 1897, 1899; for historical reviews, see, e.g., Adams, 1987, and Feltovich et al., 2006), but a decisive influence came from the computational approach to studies of information processing in human problem solving promoted by Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and others (Newell & Simon, 1972). In seminal studies, based on earlier work by de Groot (1965/1978), this approach was applied to the analysis of cognitive processes underlying chess playing in expert chess players by Simon and Chase (1973; Chase & Simon, 1973b). From the beginning, there was thus a strong interest in understanding how information processing in experts differs from that of novices.

在过去的二十年里，一个对心理学中专业知识研究产生了巨大影响的理论框架是由埃里克森和他的同事们发展的专家表现框架（Ericsson & Smith, 1991; Ericsson & Ward, 2007; Feltovich, Prietula, & Ericsson, 2006）。这个框架特别强调了通过客观的、标准化的、具有代表性的任务来衡量专家表现的重要性，而不是依赖于评价者的估计、资格证书或教育水平等更间接的专业知识指标（Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996; Ericsson & Ward, 2007）。这种研究方法的起源可以追溯到关于复杂技能学习的早期研究（Bryan & Harter, 1897, 1899；参见 Adams, 1987; Feltovich et al., 2006 的历史回顾），但对其产生决定性影响的是艾伦·纽厄尔和赫伯特·西蒙等人推广的，用于研究人类解决问题时信息处理的计算方法（Newell & Simon, 1972）。在一系列开创性的研究中，这种方法被应用于分析国际象棋专家在下棋时的认知过程，这些研究基于德·格鲁特的早期工作（1965/1978），由西蒙和蔡斯进行（Simon and Chase, 1973; Chase & Simon, 1973b）。因此，从一开始，研究者就非常关注专家在信息处理方面与新手的差异，试图深入理解这些差异的本质。

Although fundamentally different from classical behaviorism in its focus on the internal representations and processes underlying skilled behavior, in one important sense, the expert performance framework can be seen as a continuation of the tradition from Watson: its strong emphasis on the importance of acquired characteristics for expertise (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993). In particular, this framework proposes that expert performance reflects the accumulated amount of deliberate practice, defined as explicit, effortful, goal-directed activities that are specifically designed to improve performance. The expert performance framework further proposes that merely spending time with an activity without any effort or intention to improve performance results in minimal, if any, improvement of skill (Ericsson, 2006). In fact, a cornerstone of the expert performance framework is that deliberate practice is not only important, or necessary, for expert performance but also sufficient to account for the major facts of expert performance (Ericsson, 2007, 2014a; Ericsson et al., 1993; Ericsson, Roring, & Nandagopal, 2007a). As Ericsson et al. (1993) stated, High levels of deliberate practice are necessary to attain expert level performance. Our theoretical framework can also provide a sufficient account of the major facts about the nature and scarcity of exceptional performance. Our account does not depend on scarcity of innate ability (talent). (p. 392, italics added)

虽然专家表现框架在关注技能背后的内在表征和过程上与传统的行为主义截然不同，但它在一个关键点上可视为继承了沃森的思想传统，即强调后天获得的特性对于专业知识的重要性（Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993）。这一框架特别认为，专家级的表现是长时间积累的刻意练习的结果，刻意练习被定义为那些专为提升技能而设计的明确目标、需付出努力的活动。专家表现框架还强调，如果仅仅是进行活动而不是有意识地努力改善，那么技能的提升将非常有限，甚至几乎没有（Ericsson, 2006）。事实上，专家表现框架的核心观点是，刻意练习不仅对达到专家级表现至关重要，甚至足以解释专家表现的主要现象（Ericsson, 2007, 2014a; Ericsson et al., 1993; Ericsson, Roring, & Nandagopal, 2007a）。正如 Ericsson 等人（1993）指出的，达到专家级别的表现必须通过大量的刻意练习。我们的理论框架足以全面说明卓越表现的本质和其稀有性的主要事实。值得注意的是，我们的分析并不依赖于天生才能的稀缺性。（第 392 页，斜体部分已调整）

We will henceforth refer to this theory as the deliberate practice theory. According to the deliberate practice theory, other variables may matter for performance differences among novices, but with sufficient deliberate practice, the effects of such factors are bypassed or “circumvented.” In other words, for healthy individuals, the level of performance in a domain is essentially limited by the amount of deliberate practice they have accumulated (Ericsson, 2007; Ericsson et al., 1993).

从此刻起，我们将此理论称之为刻意练习理论。刻意练习理论认为，尽管其他因素可能影响新手之间的表现差异，但通过充分的刻意练习，这些因素的影响可以被忽略或者绕开。也就是说，对于健康的人而言，他们在某一领域内的表现水平，实际上是由他们所进行的刻意练习的数量所限定的（Ericsson, 2007; Ericsson et al., 1993）。

Research on expert performance and its relation to deliberate practice has substantially increased our understanding of high-level performance and achievement. The present review begins with a summary of some general observations in the field that are well supported by data and that are of particular theoretical interest because they appear to hold true across different domains of expertise. We then review findings that seriously challenge deliberate practice theory, focusing in particular on findings from recent studies demonstrating that variables other than deliberate practice account for individual differences in expertise. In the final section, we argue that deliberate practice theory fails to account for major recent findings relating to expertise and expert performance, and propose an alternative framework for understanding and investigating expertise—the multifactorial gene–environment interaction model (MGIM).

对专家表现及其与刻意练习的关系进行的研究，极大地拓宽了我们对高水平成就的理解。本篇综述首先总结了一些在不同专业知识领域普遍适用、并且得到数据良好支持的基本观察点，这些点因其特殊的理论价值而引人注目。接下来，我们将审视那些对刻意练习理论构成严峻挑战的研究成果，特别是那些最新研究表明，个体在专业知识上的差异不仅仅由刻意练习所能解释的发现。在综述的最后部分，我们将论证刻意练习理论未能充分解释关于专业知识和专家表现的一些重要新发现，并提出一个新的框架来理解和探索专业知识 —— 即多因素基因-环境互动模型（MGIM）。

The literature considered in the present review includes studies on expertise and deliberate practice identified from earlier reviews and books, as well as from systematic literature searches in Web of Science using the search terms “expertise” OR “expert performance,” “imaging,” and “transfer,” and the Web of Sciences categories “neurosciences,” “neuroimaging,” “psychology,” “behavioral sciences,” and “genetics heredity.” Details on the literature search are provided as online supplemental materials.

The breadth of the field makes it impossible to perform an exhaustive review of all original studies in a single review article. Our main focus is therefore on studies from the last few decades. Finally, it should be stressed that we primarily consider a number of expertise domains that have been extensively studied in the deliberate practice literature, including music, dance, board games, video games, and sports. Other forms of expertise, such as academic expertise, will only be discussed more tangentially.

鉴于这个领域的广泛性，想要在一篇综述文章中彻底审查所有原始研究是不现实的。因此，我们主要关注的是近几十年的研究成果。最后，需要特别指出的是，我们主要关注那些在刻意练习文献中被广泛研究的专业领域，如音乐、舞蹈、棋类游戏、电子游戏和体育等。而像学术专业知识这样的其他专业形式，则会被更间接地讨论。

### 01. The Neuropsychology of Expertise 

#### 1.1 Practice, Expertise, and Brain Anatomy

A large amount of empirical data supports that cumulative estimates of lifetime deliberate practice are positively associated with measures of expertise (Hambrick, Oswald, et al., 2014; Macnamara, Hambrick, & Oswald, 2014; Platz, Kopiez, Lehmann, & Wolf, 2014). A meta-analysis of 88 published studies corroborates this basic finding (Macnamara et al, 2014); for a comprehensive bibliography, we refer the reader to the supplementary material of that article. Correlations between practice and expertise have been demonstrated using various measures of both practice (interview data, questionnaires, logs) and expertise (objective measures of expert performance, ratings, professional status). The literature covers a wide range of domains, including arts, sports, games, education, and professions (Ericsson et al., 1993; Hambrick, Oswald, et al., 2014; C. U. Hutchinson, Sachs-Ericsson, & Ericsson, 2013; Macnamara et al., 2014; Platz et al., 2014; Tucker & Collins, 2012). Macnamara and colleagues (2014) found an overall metaanalytic average correlation between deliberate practice and expert performance of r .35 across domains. However, the effect size of the relation varied between domains. The percentage of variance in expert performance explained by deliberate practice was 1% for professions, 4% for education, 18% for sports, 21% for music, and 26% for games. In another meta-analysis, Platz and colleagues (2014) found that deliberate practice could account for 36% of the variance in musical expertise. For further discussion of these associations, see the Challenges to Deliberate Practice Theory section.

大量的实证研究数据显示，一个人一生中累积的刻意练习量与他们的专业技能水平正相关（Hambrick, Oswald, et al., 2014; Macnamara, Hambrick, & Oswald, 2014; Platz, Kopiez, Lehmann, & Wolf, 2014）。一项涉及 88 个研究的元分析进一步证实了这一基本观点（Macnamara et al, 2014）；对于更详细的参考资料，我们建议读者查阅该研究的在线补充材料。通过不同的练习（如面试数据、问卷、日志）和专业知识（如专家表现的客观测量、评价、职业地位）测量方法，研究证明了练习与专业技能之间的相关性。这些研究覆盖了包括艺术、体育、游戏、教育和职业等广泛领域（Ericsson et al., 1993; Hambrick, Oswald, et al., 2014; C. U. Hutchinson, Sachs-Ericsson, & Ericsson, 2013; Macnamara et al., 2014; Platz et al., 2014; Tucker & Collins, 2012）。Macnamara 及其团队（2014）发现，跨领域的刻意练习与专家表现之间的平均相关性为 r .35。但是，这种相关性的效应大小在不同领域之间有所差异，刻意练习解释专家表现方差的百分比在不同领域中从 1% 到 26% 不等。在另一项元分析中，Platz 及其同事（2014）发现刻意练习可以解释音乐专业知识方差的 36%。有关这些相关性的进一步讨论，请参见挑战刻意练习理论部分。

Common sense and everyday experience make it tempting to assume that correlations between deliberate practice and expert performance reflect causal effects of the former on the latter. At the same time, correlational findings are often consistent with many underlying causal mechanisms, and recent findings suggest that alternative scenarios also have to be considered. Evidence has emerged that at least some components of expert performance are not causally influenced by deliberate practice (see the Challenges to Deliberate Practice Theory section). However, studies investigating the acquisition of expertise longitudinally based on single cases (Ericsson, Chase, & Faloon, 1980), or observational (Campitelli & Gobet, 2008; de Bruin, Kok, Leppink, & Camp, 2014; Howard, 2012; Hyde et al., 2009; Jabusch, Alpers, Kopiez, Vauth, & Altenmüller, 2009; McPherson, 2005) and randomized (Bilhartz, Bruhn, & Olson, 1999; Scholz, Klein, Behrens, & JohansenBerg, 2009) group designs suggest that, as expected, long-term deliberate practice is an essential causal factor behind many aspects of expert performance.

虽然常识和日常经验容易让人认为刻意练习与专家表现之间的相关性意味着因果关系，但同时，相关性研究结果常常可以由多种潜在的因果机制来解释，近期的发现提示我们还需考虑其他可能的解释。至少有一些证据表明，并非所有专家表现的组成部分都是由刻意练习直接导致的（见挑战刻意练习理论部分）。然而，基于个案的纵向研究（Ericsson, Chase, & Faloon, 1980），以及观察性（Campitelli & Gobet, 2008; de Bruin, Kok, Leppink, & Camp, 2014; Howard, 2012; Hyde et al., 2009; Jabusch, Alpers, Kopiez, Vauth, & Altenmüller, 2009; McPherson, 2005）和随机分组（Bilhartz, Bruhn, & Olson, 1999; Scholz, Klein, Behrens, & Johansen-Berg, 2009）设计的研究表明，长期的刻意练习是许多专家表现方面的一个关键因果因素，正如我们所预期的。

Many studies have also investigated expertise using neuroimaging techniques. This literature, which mainly consists of correlational studies, further adds to the evidence that deliberate practice is an important predictor of expertise, and suggests that individual differences in regional brain anatomy may in part mediate associations found between deliberate practice and expert performance on the behavioral level. One of the most frequently studied domains in this literature is musicians (Münte, Altenmüller, & Jäncke, 2002; Zatorre, Fields, & Johansen-Berg, 2012). Correlations between musical expertise and regional brain anatomy have been reported for motor and premotor areas (Amunts et al., 1997; Bangert & Schlaug, 2006; Bermudez, Lerch, Evans, & Zatorre, 2009; Gaser & Schlaug, 2003; Han et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2009), Broca’s area (Abdul-Kareem, Stancak, Parkes, & Sluming, 2011; Gaser & Schlaug, 2003; Sluming et al., 2002), auditory areas (Bermudez et al., 2009; Elmer, Hänggi, Meyer, & Jancke, 2013; Fauvel et al., 2014; Gaser & Schlaug, 2003; Hyde et al., 2009; Pantev & Herholz, 2011; Schneider et al., 2002; SeitherPreisler, Parncutt, & Schneider, 2014), the cerebellum (S. Hutchinson, Lee, Gaab, & Schlaug, 2003), and white matter pathways implicated in musical performance, such as the corpus callosum (Bengtsson et al., 2005; Schlaug, Jäncke, Huang, Staiger, & Steinmetz, 1995; Steele, Bailey, Zatorre, & Penhune, 2013; Vollmann et al., 2014), the superior longitudinal fasciculus (Oechslin, Van De Ville, Lazeyras, Hauert, & James, 2013), and the pyramidal tracts (Bengtsson et al., 2005; Han et al., 2009).

许多研究通过神经成像技术探索了专业知识的形成。这些主要基于相关性的研究进一步证明了刻意练习对于专业知识形成的重要性，并指出在行为层面上发现的刻意练习与专家表现之间的联系，可能部分由大脑结构的个体差异所中介。在这方面的文献中，音乐家是被研究得最频繁的一个群体（Münte, Altenmüller, & Jäncke, 2002; Zatorre, Fields, & Johansen-Berg, 2012）。研究报告指出，音乐专业知识与大脑的特定区域结构之间存在相关性，这些区域包括运动和前运动区（Amunts et al., 1997; Bangert & Schlaug, 2006; Bermudez, Lerch, Evans, & Zatorre, 2009; Gaser & Schlaug, 2003; Han et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2009）、布洛卡区（Abdul-Kareem, Stancak, Parkes, & Sluming, 2011; Gaser & Schlaug, 2003; Sluming et al., 2002）、听觉区（Bermudez et al., 2009; Elmer, Hänggi, Meyer, & Jancke, 2013; Fauvel et al., 2014; Gaser & Schlaug, 2003; Hyde et al., 2009; Pantev & Herholz, 2011; Schneider et al., 2002; SeitherPreisler, Parncutt, & Schneider, 2014）、小脑（S. Hutchinson, Lee, Gaab, & Schlaug, 2003），以及与音乐表现相关的白质通路，如胼胝体（Bengtsson et al., 2005; Schlaug, Jäncke, Huang, Staiger, & Steinmetz, 1995; Steele, Bailey, Zatorre, & Penhune, 2013; Vollmann et al., 2014）、上纵束（Oechslin, Van De Ville, Lazeyras, Hauert, & James, 2013），和锥体束（Bengtsson et al., 2005; Han et al., 2009）。这些发现进一步加深了我们对刻意练习如何影响专业技能发展，以及大脑结构如何参与这一过程的理解。

Several studies have also reported significant correlations between measures of practice and regional brain anatomy in brain regions that show group differences in anatomy between musicians and nonmusicians. Amunts and colleagues (1997) found a Spearman correlation of -.63 to -.60 between the size of motor cortex and age of commencement of musical training. Sluming and colleagues (2002) found a correlation of r = .39 between years of musical training and gray matter volume in Broca’s area in younger adult musicians, and Abdul-Kareem et al. (2011) reported a correlation of r = .7 between the gray matter volume of this region and years of performance in orchestra musicians. As another example, S. Hutchinson et al. (2003) found a correlation of r = .60 between cerebellar volume and lifelong intensity of training in male musicians.

一系列的研究揭示了练习量与音乐家与非音乐家之间在脑结构上存在差异的脑区之间的显著相关性。Amunts 及其团队（1997）在运动皮层的大小与音乐训练开始年龄之间发现了一个 -.63 到 -.60 的斯皮尔曼相关系数。Sluming 及其同事（2002）在年轻的成人音乐家中发现音乐训练年数与布洛卡区灰质体积之间的相关性为 r = .39，Abdul-Kareem 等人（2011）则报告了这一区域灰质体积与管弦乐队音乐家的表演年数之间 r = .7 的相关性。另外，S. Hutchinson 等人（2003）发现男性音乐家中小脑体积与一生训练强度之间的相关性为 r = .60。

Correlational data also support that brain adaptations in musicians are functionally important. Hyde and colleagues (2009) used a longitudinal design and studied associations between performance improvements on relevant behavioral tasks and changes in regional anatomy after 15 months of musical training. Performance on a manual motor sequence task correlated with anatomical changes in primary motor cortex (r = .45), as well as the corpus callosum (r = .45). Performance on an auditory musical discrimination task correlated with anatomical changes in primary auditory cortex (r = .40). Schneider et al. (2002) found a correlation of r = .70 between the gray matter volume of auditory cortex and auditory musical discrimination in a mixed sample of amateur and professional musicians.

这些相关性数据还强调了音乐家大脑适应的功能重要性。Hyde 及其同事（2009）通过一项纵向研究，探讨了 15 个月音乐训练后，在相关行为任务表现改善与大脑区域结构变化之间的联系。手部运动序列任务表现与初级运动皮层（r = .45）和胼胝体（r = .45）的结构变化相关联。而在听觉音乐辨识任务表现上，则与初级听觉皮层的结构变化相关（r = .40）。Schneider 等人（2002）在一个混合了业余和职业音乐家的样本中，发现听觉皮层灰质体积与听觉音乐辨识能力之间的相关性为 r = .70。这些研究不仅揭示了音乐训练与大脑解剖学变化之间的密切联系，还强调了这些大脑适应对音乐家功能表现的重要性。

Similar associations between expertise and regional neuroanatomy have also been found for other groups, including taxi drivers (Maguire et al., 2000; Woollett & Maguire, 2011), jugglers (Draganski et al., 2004; Gerber et al., 2014; Scholz et al., 2009), dancers (Hänggi, Koeneke, Bezzola, & Jäncke, 2010), professional simultaneous interpreters (Elmer, Hänggi, Meyer, & Jancke, 2011), painters (Lorains, Ball, & MacMahon, 2013), chess players (Hänggi, Brütsch, Siegel, & Jancke, 2014), professional car drivers (Bernardi et al., 2014), karate experts (Roberts, Bain, Day, & Husain, 2013), perfumers (Delon-Martin, Plailly, Fonlupt, Veyrac, & Royet, 2013), and athletes (Jäncke, Koeneke, Hoppe, Rominger, & Hänggi, 2009; Wei, Zhang, Jiang, & Luo, 2011). Furthermore, longitudinal studies provide support for a causal effect of practice (Draganski et al., 2004; Hyde et al., 2009; Scholz et al., 2009; Woollett & Maguire, 2011). 

Overall, then, there is substantial evidence that deliberate practice is associated with higher levels of expertise and that this association at least partly reflects causal influences of deliberate practice on expert performance and its underlying neural substrates.

对于包括出租车司机、杂技演员、舞者、专业同声传译员、画家、国际象棋选手、职业赛车手、空手道专家、调香师和运动员在内的多个专家群体，研究同样发现了他们的专业技能与大脑特定区域的结构之间存在显著的相关性（Maguire et al., 2000; Woollett & Maguire, 2011; Draganski et al., 2004; Gerber et al., 2014; Scholz et al., 2009; Hänggi, Koeneke, Bezzola, & Jäncke, 2010; Elmer, Hänggi, Meyer, & Jancke, 2011; Lorains, Ball, & MacMahon, 2013; Hänggi, Brütsch, Siegel, & Jancke, 2014; Bernardi et al., 2014; Roberts, Bain, Day, & Husain, 2013; Delon-Martin, Plailly, Fonlupt, Veyrac, & Royet, 2013; Jäncke, Koeneke, Hoppe, Rominger, & Hänggi, 2009; Wei, Zhang, Jiang, & Luo, 2011）。此外，一系列纵向研究强调了练习对于这些专业技能发展的因果作用（Draganski et al., 2004; Hyde et al., 2009; Scholz et al., 2009; Woollett & Maguire, 2011）。

因此，有充分的证据表明，刻意练习与更高级别的专业技能之间存在密切关联，这种关联至少部分揭示了刻意练习对专家表现及其神经基础的直接影响。这些发现不仅展示了不同领域专家大脑结构的共性变化，也强调了长期、有目的的练习在塑造这些结构中的核心作用，从而进一步证实了刻意练习理论在多个专业领域的普适性和重要性。

#### 1.2 Expert–Novice Differences in Information Processing and Functional Brain Properties

The literature on complex skill learning is vast. However, much of this research has used relatively short training periods (hours to days). A central finding in the expertise literature is that prolonged deliberate practice, continuing for months and years, may lead to the acquisition of qualitatively different performance strategies, which enable experts to perform at levels that baffle beginners (Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996; Feltovich et al., 2006). A dramatic illustration of this is Ericsson and colleagues’ (1980) longitudinal case study of a participant (SF) who engaged in regular practice of a digit memory span task for more than 1.5 years. During this period, SF’s memory span increased from seven to almost 80 digits—an increase of more than an order of magnitude. Verbal reports and analyses of temporal response patterns showed that this remarkable improvement relied on a gradual mastery of more and more complex memorization strategies. In particular, SF used his extensive knowledge of track and running times to chunk sequences of digits and represented number sequences hierarchically as groups and supergroups of shorter subsequences.

关于复杂技能学习的研究极其广泛。尽管如此，大多数研究采用的训练周期相对较短，从几小时到几天不等。专业知识领域的一个关键发现是，持续数月甚至数年的刻意练习可能导致质的不同的表现策略的形成，这些策略使得专家能够达到让初学者感到困惑的表现水平（Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996; Feltovich et al., 2006）。一个生动的例证是 Ericsson 及其同事（1980）对参与者 SF 进行的纵向个案研究，SF 在超过 1.5 年的时间里定期练习数字记忆跨度任务。在此期间，SF 的记忆跨度从七个数字增长到近 80 个数字，增长了超过十倍。口头报告和时间响应模式的分析表明，这一显著的进步依赖于逐渐掌握越来越复杂的记忆策略。特别是，SF 利用他对跑道和跑步时间的丰富知识，将数字序列分块，并以层次化的方式将数字序列表示为更短的子序列组和超组。

There is evidence for extremely efficient processing of domainspecific information in many forms of expertise. One welldocumented phenomenon, illustrated by SF, is that experts can represent large, complex structures as integrated units, or “chunks” (Feltovich et al., 2006). Pioneering studies on expert performance demonstrated such chunking in chess experts, who display superior memory for chess game positions compared with novices (Charness, 1976; Chase & Simon, 1973b; de Groot, 1978; Simon & Chase, 1973). Similar phenomena have been demonstrated in many other expert groups, including bridge players (Engle & Bukstel, 1978), Go players (Reitman, 1976), Othello players (Wolff, Mitchell, & Frey, 1984), computer programmers (McKeithen, Reitman, Rueter, & Hirtle, 1981), taxi drivers (Kalakoski & Saariluoma, 2001), electronic technicians (Egan & Schwartz, 1979), and musicians (Halpern & Bower, 1982; Kalakoski, 2007; Sloboda, 1976, 1978; Waters, Townsend, & Underwood, 1998; Waters, Underwood, & Findlay, 1997).

在许多专业知识形式中，都有证据显示对特定领域信息的处理极其高效。SF 的例子说明了一个被广泛记录的现象，即专家能够将大型、复杂的结构整合为单元或「块」（Feltovich et al., 2006）。先驱性的专家表现研究展示了象棋专家如何通过分块来展现超越新手的象棋游戏位置记忆能力（Charness, 1976; Chase & Simon, 1973b; de Groot, 1978; Simon & Chase, 1973）。类似的现象在许多其他专家群体中也被展示，包括桥牌玩家、围棋玩家、奥赛罗棋玩家、计算机程序员、出租车司机、电子技术员和音乐家等（Engle & Bukstel, 1978; Reitman, 1976; Wolff, Mitchell, & Frey, 1984; McKeithen, Reitman, Rueter, & Hirtle, 1981; Kalakoski & Saariluoma, 2001; Egan & Schwartz, 1979; Halpern & Bower, 1982; Kalakoski, 2007; Sloboda, 1976, 1978; Waters, Townsend, & Underwood, 1998; Waters, Underwood, & Findlay, 1997）。这些研究不仅揭示了专家如何通过分块策略高效处理复杂信息，也突显了刻意练习在形成这些高级技能策略中的核心作用。

Importantly, chunk formation in experts reflects functional properties and relations between the elements in a chunk. Experts’ superior memory is typically most pronounced for ecologically valid patterns, as opposed to constellations that are unlikely to appear in real life expert performance. Chess experts display superior memory for game positions from real games, but to a much lower degree for random positions, and the grouping of pieces into chunks is based on the strategic relations between pieces (Chase & Simon, 1973b; Gobet & Simon, 1996a, 1996b; Saariluoma, 1994; Simon & Chase, 1973). In bridge (Engle & Bukstel, 1978), experts have superior memory for structured (i.e., ecological), but not for unstructured, bridge hands. Experienced programmers chunk computer code efficiently, based on its functional organization; beginners utilize common-language associations (McKeithen et al., 1981). Taxi drivers show exceptional memory for street names when these are organized according to driving routes, but not for randomly organized lists (Kalakoski & Saariluoma, 2001). Musicians display superior processing of well-formed, as opposed to random, musical structures (Halpern & Bower, 1982; Kalakoski, 2007; Meinz & Salthouse, 1998; Sloboda, 1976) and process musical materials using larger units than novices (Waters et al., 1997, 1998).

在专家中形成的信息块反映了块内元素之间的功能性属性和联系。专家对于生态有效模式的记忆尤为突出，这些模式是指在真实专业表现中可能出现的复杂结构，与那些不太可能出现的配置相比。例如，象棋专家对实际比赛中棋局位置的记忆远胜于随机排列的位置，这种记忆力的优势基于对棋子间战略关系的分组（Chase & Simon, 1973b; Gobet & Simon, 1996a, 1996b; Saariluoma, 1994; Simon & Chase, 1973）。在桥牌、编程、出租车驾驶、音乐等多个领域，专家都展现了对结构化信息的超群记忆，这种记忆是基于信息的功能性组织进行的有效分块（Engle & Bukstel, 1978; McKeithen et al., 1981; Kalakoski & Saariluoma, 2001; Halpern & Bower, 1982; Kalakoski, 2007; Meinz & Salthouse, 1998; Sloboda, 1976）。

Clearly, these findings suggest that domain-specific information retained in long-term memory (LTM) is important for expertise. Mechanisms allowing for efficient interactions between LTM storage and working memory (WM), increasing the functional capacity of WM for domain-specific information, could be key to expert performance. Chase and Simon (1973a, 1973b) proposed a chunking theory to account for expert performance in chess. This theory proposes that players store patterns of pieces that occur frequently in games as chunks in LTM. Game positions can then be represented in WM as chunks rather than as single pieces. Even if experts and novices have the same general WM span, the experts will, in this way, display a higher effective WM capacity for game positions in chess. This may not just boost memory performance, but could also result in higher playing skills by making the search among possible moves and their evaluation much more selective and efficient.

这些发现突显了长期记忆中保留的特定领域信息对于专业技能的重要性。长期记忆与工作记忆之间的高效互动，提高了工作记忆在处理特定领域信息时的功能容量，这可能是专家级表现的关键。Chase 和 Simon 通过他们的分块理论提出，象棋玩家将游戏中频繁出现的棋子模式作为信息块存储在长期记忆中，使得在工作记忆中可以将游戏位置以信息块而非单个棋子的形式来呈现。这样，尽管专家和新手在一般的工作记忆跨度上可能相同，专家在象棋游戏位置上显示出了更高的有效工作记忆容量。这种高效的信息处理不仅提升了记忆表现，还可能通过使对可能棋步的搜索和评估变得更加精准和高效，进而提高了游戏技能。

Later work has resulted in revisions and developments of these ideas. Two influential current models of information processing in experts are the long-term working memory theory of Ericsson and Kintsch (1995) and the template theory of Gobet and Simon (1996c). Long-term working memory theory assumes that experts acquire the ability to rapidly encode and retrieve domain-specific information through extensive deliberate practice, and the use of retrieval structures in which sets of cues that are associated with the encoded information are used to access it during expert performance (Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995). A central concept in template theory is the template—a flexible high-level pattern that, unlike a fixed chunk, can have both fixed and variable components and can include associative links, for example, to action plans and other templates (Gobet & Simon, 1996c).

随后的研究促进了这些理念的修订和发展。在专家信息处理研究领域，目前两个颇具影响力的模型是 Ericsson 和 Kintsch 的长期工作记忆理论（1995 年）以及 Gobet 与 Simon 的模板理论（1996c 年）。长期工作记忆理论认为，专家通过大量的刻意练习，获得了快速编码与检索特定领域信息的能力，并能利用检索结构，在专家表现时利用与编码信息相关的提示来访问这些信息（Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995）。模板理论的一个核心概念是模板 —— 与固定的信息块不同，模板是一个灵活的高级模式，它能包含固定和可变的组成部分，并且能够包含例如指向行动计划和其他模板的关联链接（Gobet & Simon, 1996c）。

At present, there is little data on how the dramatic changes in information processing implied by these theories may be implemented on a neural level. Notably, efficient use of information in LTM is a central feature of all the models that have been discussed. One possibility would thus be that the medial temporal cortex and other brain areas implicated in LTM are active in aspects of expert performance involving online manipulation of information in WM. This idea was recently developed in a review by Guida, Gobet, Tardieu, and Nicolas (2012), who have found support for activation of LTM regions during expert performance in mental calculators, mnemonists, and chess experts.

目前，我们对这些理论所描述的信息处理的戏剧性变化如何在神经层面上实现的了解仍然有限。所有讨论的模型中一个共通的特征是长期记忆（LTM）中信息的高效使用。因此，一种可能的解释是，内侧颞皮层以及其他与长期记忆有关的脑区在专家表现中处理工作记忆（WM）信息的在线操作方面可能处于活跃状态。Guida 等人（2012）最近的综述进一步发展了这一想法，他们找到了在心算高手、记忆大师和象棋专家的专家表现中，长期记忆区域活跃的证据。

这些讨论不仅拓展了我们对专家信息处理机制的理解，也指向了未来研究中探索这些理论在神经层面实现的可能方向，强调了深入研究长期记忆与工作记忆之间互动对于揭示专家表现神经基础的重要性。

One specific temporal region, the fusiform face area (FFA), has been the focus of several studies on expertise. The FFA is involved in the processing of faces (Kanwisher, McDermott, & Chun, 1997; Kanwisher & Yovel, 2006). In some expert groups, the FFA appears to have adapted so that it is also implicated in holistic processing of domain-specific visual stimuli, such as chess game positions in chess players, cars in car experts, and radiological images in radiologists (Bilali´c, Langner, Ulrich, & Grodd, 2011; Gauthier, Skudlarski, Gore, & Anderson, 2000; Gauthier, Tarr, Anderson, Skudlarski, & Gore, 1999; Harley et al., 2009; McGugin, Gatenby, Gore, & Gauthier, 2012). Furthermore, Bilali´c and colleagues (2011) found that, in chess experts but not in novices, FFA responses to random and ecological chess positions differed. This suggests that the FFA had adapted, not just to process chess stimuli in general but also to process relations between chess pieces that are potentially relevant for expert performance.

颞下回面部区（FFA）是数项关于专业知识研究的关键焦点。FFA 主要参与面部处理（Kanwisher, McDermott, & Chun, 1997; Kanwisher & Yovel, 2006），而在某些专家群体中，FFA 经过适应，也参与了特定领域视觉刺激的整体处理，例如象棋玩家对棋局位置的识别、汽车专家对车辆的识别、放射科医生对放射图像的处理（Bilali´c, Langner, Ulrich, & Grodd, 2011; Gauthier, Skudlarski, Gore, & Anderson, 2000; Gauthier, Tarr, Anderson, Skudlarski, & Gore, 1999; Harley et al., 2009; McGugin, Gatenby, Gore, & Gauthier, 2012）。特别地，Bilali´c 及其团队（2011）发现，在象棋专家中，FFA 对随机排列的和真实象棋局面的反应有所不同，这表明 FFA 不仅适应了处理象棋刺激，还适应了处理棋子间潜在相关的、对专家表现可能重要的关系。

These studies clearly show that expert performance may involve sophisticated functional adaptations in higher visual areas processing objects in the domain of expertise. However, the extent to which the FFA is evolutionarily adapted to specifically process faces, and—more generally—whether visual object processing involves modular or distributed representations in inferotemporal cortical areas, remain controversial issues (Haxby, Connolly, & Guntupalli, 2014; Haxby et al., 2001; Ishai, Ungerleider, Martin, Schouten, & Haxby, 1999; Kanwisher, 2010; Kanwisher et al., 1997; McGugin, Newton, Gore, & Gauthier, 2014).

这些研究明确显示，专家表现可能涉及对专业领域对象的高级视觉区域进行复杂功能适应。然而，FFA 特化于处理面孔的能力，以及视觉对象处理是否在颞下皮层区域采用模块化或分布式表示的方式，这些问题仍存在争议（Haxby, Connolly, & Guntupalli, 2014; Haxby et al., 2001; Ishai, Ungerleider, Martin, Schouten, & Haxby, 1999; Kanwisher, 2010; Kanwisher et al., 1997; McGugin, Newton, Gore, & Gauthier, 2014）。

Perceptual processing of domain-specific stimuli in experts can also induce extensive activations of brain regions involved in motor control and the analysis of actions. In general, areas reliably activated during action observation include the motor and premotor areas, the inferior frontal cortex, the superior and inferior parietal cortices, and the cerebellum (Abreu et al., 2012; CalvoMerino, Glaser, Grèzes, Passingham, & Haggard, 2006; Caspers, Zilles, Laird, & Eickhoff, 2010). Several studies have demonstrated that activity in this network may differ between experts and novices during observation of domain-specific actions (Chang, 2014; Liew, Sheng, Margetis, & Aziz-Zadeh, 2013; Zatorre, Chen, & Penhune, 2007). Balser, Lorey, Pilgramm, Naumann, et al. (2014) found stronger activation of superior parietal cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the cerebellum when experts in tennis and volleyball observed tennis and volleyball serves, respectively, than when they observed serves in the nontrained sport. The same group also found that tennis players had higher activity than novices in action-observation-related brain areas during a domain-specific motor anticipation task (Balser, Lorey, Pilgramm, Stark, et al., 2014). Similarly, Calvo-Merino, Glaser, Grèzes, Passingham, and Haggard (2005) compared ballet and capoeira dancers and found higher activity in premotor and parietal regions when the participants’ observed movements from their trained dance than when they viewed the untrained dance. Wright, Bishop, Jackson, and Abernethy (2013) found greater activation in action observation regions during visual discrimination of soccer moves in skilled than in unskilled soccer players. Pianists showed higher activity than controls in action observation areas as well as auditory areas during observation of piano playing (Haslinger et al., 2005). Activation of motor areas in experts has been observed not just during domain-specific action observation but also during perception of more abstract stimuli that are associated with actions in the domain of expertise. For instance, Woods, Hernandez, Wagner, and Beilock (2014) found higher activity in sensorimotor and premotor areas in athletes than in novices during perception of sport-related environmental sounds. Behmer and Jantzen (2011) used EEG to compare brain activity in musicians and nonmusicians during passive observation of sheet music. A significantly stronger desynchronization of the sensorimotor mu rhythm, indicating an activation of the motor system, was found in the musicians. Lyons et al. (2010) found that hockey players, compared with novices, had higher activity in motor areas during passive listening to verbal stimuli (sentences) relating to ice hockey.

在专家中，对特定领域刺激的感知处理不仅涉及视觉处理区域，还广泛激活了参与运动控制和动作分析的大脑区域。一般来说，动作观察期间可靠地激活了运动和前运动区、下额叶皮层、上下顶叶皮层以及小脑等区域（Abreu et al., 2012; CalvoMerino, Glaser, Grèzes, Passingham, & Haggard, 2006; Caspers, Zilles, Laird, & Eickhoff, 2010）。研究显示，专家与新手在观察特定领域动作时，这一网络中的活动存在差异（Chang, 2014; Liew, Sheng, Margetis, & Aziz-Zadeh, 2013; Zatorre, Chen, & Penhune, 2007）。例如，Balser 及其同事（2014）发现，网球和排球专家在观察各自训练运动的发球动作时，上顶叶皮层、辅助运动区和小脑的激活更强，与观察非专业运动的发球动作相比。此外，当参与者观察来自他们训练舞蹈的动作时，相较于观察未经训练的舞蹈，芭蕾舞者和卡波耶拉舞者在前运动区和顶叶区域的活动更为强烈（Calvo-Merino, Glaser, Grèzes, Passingham, 和 Haggard，2005）。

这些研究清楚地表明，专家表现可能涉及对专业领域对象进行复杂功能适应的高级视觉区域。更进一步，专家在感知与他们专业领域动作相关的更抽象刺激时，也会观察到运动区域的激活，如运动员在感知与运动相关的环境声音时，或音乐家在被动观察乐谱时，展现出比新手更强的运动区域活动（Woods, Hernandez, Wagner, 和 Beilock，2014; Behmer 和 Jantzen，2011）。这些发现不仅揭示了专家大脑对于特定领域信息的敏感性和高级处理能力，也强调了在专家表现中，感知处理与运动控制和动作分析之间存在着密切的联系。

These findings indicate that functional reorganizations within distributed brain networks for the planning and control of actions may be important for forms of expertise that involve sensorimotor skills. A few studies have also used fMRI to find direct evidence for altered functional connectivity in experts. Fauvel et al. (2014) reported numerous differences in resting state functional connectivity between musicians and nonmusicians, including enhanced connections between temporal and frontal regions that could reflect adaptations in neural circuits for auditory-motor integration. Pinho, de Manzano, Fransson, Eriksson, and Ullén (2014) measured brain activity during improvisation in classical and jazz pianists, and found higher functional connectivity between prefrontal and premotor areas in the experienced improvisers, which could reflect a more efficient exchange of information within associative networks of importance for generation of music.

这些研究表明，在分布式大脑网络中，动作规划和控制的功能性重组对于涉及感觉运动技能的专业知识至关重要。少数研究通过 fMRI 直接证明了专家中功能连接的改变。例如，Fauvel 等人（2014）在音乐家与非音乐家间发现了静息状态下功能连接的显著差异，特别是颞区与额区之间连接的增强，这可能反映了听觉 - 运动整合在神经回路上的适应。Pinho 等人（2014）在测量古典与爵士钢琴家即兴演奏时的大脑活动时，观察到经验丰富的即兴演奏者在前额叶与前运动区之间展现了更高的功能连接，这可能表明了在对音乐生成至关重要的联想网络内，信息交换的效率更高。

The high domain specificity of many of the effects discussed above would make it plausible that causal effects of deliberate practice are involved in the observed expert–novice differences. However, the literature essentially consists of correlational data and observational longitudinal designs, and it is therefore also possible that other causal mechanisms, such as genetic pleiotropy, are involved.

这些讨论的效应因其高度的领域特异性，令人合理推测刻意练习在观察到的专家与新手之间的差异中可能起到了因果作用。然而，现有文献主要基于相关性数据和观察性纵向设计，这也意味着可能存在其他因果机制，例如遗传多效性，参与其中。

这些发现不仅突显了专家大脑在感觉运动技能相关领域的适应性变化，也指向了未来研究需要进一步探索刻意练习与这些神经网络功能性重组之间的直接联系。同时，这也提醒我们在解释专家与新手之间的表现差异时，要考虑多种可能的因果机制。

#### 1.3 Expertise and Transfer

Near transfer. Transfer refers to influences of training on nontrained tasks and skills (Adams, 1987; Barnett & Ceci, 2002; R. A. Schmidt & Lee, 1999). One of the most influential theoretical accounts of transfer, the identical elements theory, originates with three papers by Thorndike and Woodworth from 1901. These articles discuss results from a series of experiments in which participants were trained on a variety of tasks that included detecting and marking words with particular properties in a text (Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901b), and judgment tasks in which the size of geometrical figures (Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901a; Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901) and weights of objects (Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901a) should be estimated. Participants improved on the trained tasks, but transfer effects to highly similar control tasks (marking words with other properties than those trained; estimating the size of figures with new shapes or sizes, or weights of novel objects) appeared to be remarkably small or negligible. However, the authors found indications of some transfer, in particular when the trained task and the transfer task shared elements (e.g., marking words that contain “s” and “p” at transfer, after training to mark words that contain “s” and “e”). The overall conclusions were that transfer of skills essentially occurs when the trained skill and the transfer task contain identical elements, and—in more general terms—that the mind is “a machine for making particular reactions to particular situations,” which “works in great detail, adapting itself to the special data of which it has had experience” (Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901, pp. 249–250).

近距离转移指的是训练在未直接接受训练的任务和技能上的影响（Adams, 1987; Barnett & Ceci, 2002; R. A. Schmidt & Lee, 1999）。转移理论中最具影响力的之一是「相同元素理论」，该理论由 Thorndike 和 Woodworth 在 1901 年发表的三篇论文中首次提出。这些研究通过一系列实验探讨了参与者在一系列任务上的训练效果，任务包括在文本中检测并标记具有特定特征的单词，以及估计几何图形的大小和物体的重量。实验结果显示，参与者在训练任务上表现提升，但对于与训练任务高度相似的控制任务（如标记具有不同特征的单词，估计新形状或大小的图形，或新奇物体的重量）的转移效果却非常有限。然而，研究者还是观察到了一些转移现象，尤其是当训练任务与转移任务具有共同元素时（例如，在训练中标记含有「s」和「e」的单词后，转而标记含有「s」和「p」的单词）。总的来说，技能的转移主要发生在训练技能与转移任务含有相同元素的情况下，换句话说，心智被视为「对特定情境做出特定反应的机器」，它能「精细地工作，根据自己经历的特定数据进行适应」（Thorndike & Woodworth, 1901, pp. 249–250）。

Many later studies on both sensorimotor and cognitive skills have confirmed that transfer is limited, and strongly dependent on the amount of shared material between training and transfer task (for reviews, see Adams, 1987; R. A. Schmidt & Lee, 2005; Singley & Anderson, 1989; VanLehn, 1996). For example, Bovair, Kieras, and Polson used a modern operationalization of the identical elements theory—in which procedural knowledge was quantified using a production system model (cf. Singley & Anderson, 1989)—to successfully predict transfer effects as a function of preexisting knowledge in participants learning to handle textediting software (Bovair, Kieras, & Polson, 1990; Kieras & Bovair, 1986). In line with the identical elements theory, there is also a large body of literature demonstrating part–whole transfer, in which a complex skill is mastered by training its components in isolation (Adams, 1987; R. A. Schmidt & Lee, 2005), and intermanual transfer, in which a sensorimotor skill trained with one hand is rapidly learned with the opposite hand (Hauert, Deiber, & Thut, 2002).

后续的许多研究，不论是在感觉运动技能还是认知技能方面，都证实了转移的效果是有限的，并且这种转移效果强烈依赖于训练与转移任务之间共享的内容量（参见 Adams, 1987; R. A. Schmidt & Lee, 2005; Singley & Anderson, 1989; VanLehn, 1996）。例如，Bovair、Kieras 和 Polson 采用了一种现代化的相同元素理论解释，即通过生产系统模型来量化程序知识（参见 Singley & Anderson, 1989），成功地预测了参与者在学习文本编辑软件时基于先前知识的转移效果（Bovair, Kieras, & Polson, 1990; Kieras & Bovair, 1986）。与相同元素理论相符，大量研究也展示了部分到整体的转移，即通过分别训练一个复杂技能的组成部分来掌握它（Adams, 1987; R. A. Schmidt & Lee, 2005），以及手对手的转移，即一只手训练过的感觉运动技能可以迅速地被另一只手学会（Hauert, Deiber, & Thut, 2002）。

The psychological and neurobiological literature reviewed in the previous sections suggests that the acquisition of expertise is a process of specialization, in which an individual invests time, effort, and neural resources in order to optimize the performance of a limited set of tasks. This implies that there will be few shared elements—to use Thorndike’s terminology—between expert performance and other skills, as the specific adaptations that allow for extremely efficient domain-specific information processing will often be useless in tasks outside the domain of expertise. A reasonable prediction is thus that transfer of expertise to nondomain-relevant tasks should be small.

根据前文回顾的心理学和神经生物学文献，我们了解到，专业技能的获得是一个专门化过程。在这个过程中，个体将时间、努力和神经资源投入到优化有限任务集的表现上。这就意味着，在专家的表现和其他技能之间，根据 Thorndike 的表述，共享的元素将非常少。这是因为那些使领域内信息处理极为高效的特定适应，在专业领域之外的任务中往往无用武之地。因此，可以合理预测，专业技能转移到与领域不相关的任务上的程度应该非常小。

This prediction is confirmed by empirical data. In fact, even minor changes in the materials or structure of a task can lead to dramatic performance drops, pointing to a specialization of the specialized, that is, differentiation of experts within domains. In Ericsson and colleagues’ case study of memory-span training (Ericsson et al., 1980), the participant SF had a digit memory span of close to 80 digits at the end of training, but virtually no increase in letter memory span. Bilali´c, McLeod, and Gobet (2009) studied subgroups of chess experts who had specialized in certain chess openings and compared their performance in memory and problem solving tasks, based on chess positions taken either from the openings they had specialized in or other openings. Large reductions (1 SD) in performance were found in trials based on the chess openings that were less familiar to the participants. As already summarized, large performance differences between the perceptual processing of familiar and unfamiliar patterns have been reported for many forms of expertise, including chess, bridge, and music.

实际的研究数据也证实了这一预测。事实上，哪怕是任务材料或结构的轻微变化，也可能导致表现的大幅下降，这表明了专家之间的差异化，即在特定领域内，专家们还会在更细分的领域内展现专业化。以 Ericsson 和他的同事们进行的一项记忆跨度训练案例研究为例（Ericsson et al., 1980），参与者 SF 在训练结束时数字记忆跨度近 80 位，但在字母记忆跨度上几乎没有提升。Bilalić、McLeod 和 Gobet 在 2009 年的研究中，考察了在特定国际象棋开局上有专长的国际象棋高手，他们在处理与自己专长开局相关或不相关的棋局时，在记忆和问题解决任务上的表现进行了比较。研究发现，当面对较不熟悉的国际象棋开局时，参与者的表现显著下降（下降了 1 个标准差）。正如研究所总结的那样，对于包括国际象棋、桥牌和音乐在内的许多专业技能领域，人们报告说，在处理熟悉和不熟悉的模式时，感知处理的表现存在明显差异。

Nevertheless, several studies suggest that expertise may show a certain amount of near transfer to similar tasks. Strong chess players have a somewhat better memory for random chess positions than weaker players, although the effect size is much lower than for positions from real games: Gobet and Simon (1996b) found that an increase in chess skill of 400 Elo points yielded an increase in memory capacity of about five pieces for real game positions compared with only about one piece for random positions. Expert athletes may show superior performance in related sports (Rosalie & Müller, 2012, 2014). Such findings are certainly consistent with the possibility of near transfer, which, in part, could be a consequence of shared elements between the studied tasks. However, many studies reporting near transfer rely on cross-sectional data. Thus, it is possible that correlations between expert performance and performance on nontrained tasks also depend on basic abilities that influence performance in both tasks, rather than narrow transfer (i.e., causal effects of training). In line with this possibility, Mosing, Madison, Pedersen, Kuja-Halkola, and Ullén (2014) found that the correlation between musical practice and musical perceptual ability was essentially caused by genetic pleiotropy rather than causal influences of long-term musical training on musical discrimination.

尽管如此，一些研究显示，专业技能在某种程度上可以近似转移到类似的任务。举个例子，高水平的国际象棋选手对于随机排列的棋局位置有比较初级选手更好一些的记忆，尽管这种影响的程度远远低于真实棋局位置的情况：Gobet 和 Simon 在 1996 年的研究发现，国际象棋技能提升 400 Elo 分，可以使对真实游戏位置的记忆容量增加大约五个棋子，而对随机位置的记忆容量仅增加大约一个棋子。专业运动员在相关的体育项目中也可能展现出卓越的表现（Rosalie & Müller, 2012, 2014）。这些发现无疑支持了近似转移的可能性，这在某种程度上可能是因为研究任务之间存在共同元素。然而，很多关于近似转移的研究都是基于横断面数据的。因此，专家在专业领域以外任务上的表现与非训练任务上的表现之间的相关性，可能也与两项任务表现都会受到影响的基本能力有关，而不仅仅是因为训练的直接效果。符合这种看法的是，Mosing 等人在 2014 年的研究发现，音乐练习与音乐感知能力之间的关联主要是由基因的多效性造成的，而非长期音乐训练对音乐辨识能力的直接影响。

Far transfer. The possibility of far transfer to tasks that are different from the trained task is obviously of larger practical interest, especially in education. If long-term deliberate practice would improve attention and WM, or even general intelligence, one could conceivably also see broad transfer, that is, far transfer to a wide range of cognitive tasks and general scholastic achievement. However, the empirical support for broad transfer of expertise is weak. This could be seen as unsurprising, given that even near-transfer effects are small and that the neural underpinnings of expertise and general intelligence appear to be very different, the latter apparently being more related to global brain properties such as, for example, total gray and white matter volume (Deary, Penke, & Johnson, 2010; McDaniel, 2005; Rushton & Ankney, 2009), cortical thickness (Karama et al., 2009), and general topological properties of white matter connections (Li et al., 2009). Here, we will briefly summarize findings from four domains that have been extensively studied in this context: music, chess, video games, and special “brain games” designed to improve WM.

在教育领域，特别是远距离转移到与训练任务不同的任务上的可能性具有更大的实际意义。如果长期有意识的练习能够提高注意力、工作记忆或甚至是整体智力，那么人们也许可以期待广泛的转移效果，即远距离转移到一系列认知任务和整体学术成就上。然而，关于专业技能广泛转移的实证支持非常有限。鉴于即使是近似转移效应也很小，而且专业技能和普遍智力的神经基础显著不同，这一点并不令人意外。后者似乎更与大脑的全局属性相关，如总灰质和白质体积、皮层厚度以及白质连接的总体拓扑属性等（Deary, Penke, & Johnson, 2010; McDaniel, 2005; Rushton & Ankney, 2009；Karama et al., 2009；Li et al., 2009）。下面，我们将简要概述在这方面进行了广泛研究的四个领域的发现：音乐、国际象棋、视频游戏以及旨在提升工作记忆的特殊「大脑游戏」。

The literature on music and cognitive abilities is extensive and has recently been the subject of a comprehensive review by Schellenberg and Weiss (2013). Many studies report positive associations between long-term musical practice and performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks (musical, verbal, mathematical), including tests of general IQ. Correlations between amount of musical training and intelligence are typically small to modest (r  .15 to .35; Mosing, Madison, Pedersen, & Ullén, 2015; Schellenberg & Weiss, 2013). The large majority of studies use cross-sectional or observational longitudinal designs, and thus are ambiguous with respect to the causal nature of the association. The correlation between musical practice and IQ was recently analyzed in a large Swedish twin cohort (Mosing et al., 2015). When controlling for all genetic and shared environmental influences in a monozygotic intrapair difference design, the association (r  .15) disappeared, and bivariate classical twin modeling indicated that the correlation was largely driven by genetic pleiotropy. These results speak strongly against a causal influence of musical practice on IQ, and highlight that genetic factors are important to consider in any study finding associations between practice and intelligence. Some randomized and quasi-randomized intervention studies have found indications of causal effects of musical training on cognitive abilities (Moreno et al., 2011; Schellenberg, 2004). However, other interventions—including one with no less than 3 years of piano training (Costa-Giomi, 1999)—have found no evidence for far transfer (Bilhartz et al., 1999; Mehr, Schachner, Katz, & Spelke, 2013; Moreno et al., 2009).

音乐与认知能力之间的关系是一个广泛探讨的话题，Schellenberg 和 Weiss 在 2013 年对此进行了全面的综述。众多研究显示，长期的音乐练习与在各种认知任务（如音乐、语言、数学任务，甚至包括普遍智商测试）上的表现正相关。音乐训练量与智力之间的相关性一般较小（在 0.15 到 0.35 之间；Mosing 等人，2015 年；Schellenberg 和 Weiss，2013 年）。然而，这些研究多采用横断面或观察性纵向设计，其因果关系尚不明确。最近，在瑞典进行的一项大型双胞胎研究中分析了音乐练习与 IQ 之间的相关性（Mosing 等人，2015 年）。研究控制了所有遗传因素和共享环境因素后发现，这种相关性消失了，进一步的双胞胎模型分析显示，这种相关性主要由遗传因素驱动。这些结果强烈表明音乐练习对 IQ 没有直接的因果影响，并强调在探究练习与智力之间关联的研究中考虑遗传因素的重要性。尽管一些随机和准随机的干预研究发现音乐训练可能对认知能力有因果效应（Moreno 等人，2011 年；Schellenberg，2004 年），但其他干预研究 —— 例如一项至少进行了 3 年钢琴训练的研究（Costa-Giomi，1999 年）—— 并未发现明显的远距离转移效应。

Studies of cognitive benefits of chess training have likewise yielded mixed results (Bart, 2014; Gliga & Flesner, 2014; Gobet & Campitelli, 2006). As discussed, superior processing of visual information in chess players is highly limited to ecological stimuli. Unterrainer, Kaller, Leonhart, and Rahm (2011) found no indications that chess skill transfers to the Tower of London task, which also requires planning and executive control.

国际象棋训练对认知能力的益处研究也呈现出混合的结果（Bart，2014 年；Gliga 与 Flesner，2014 年；Gobet 与 Campitelli，2006 年）。正如之前的讨论，国际象棋选手在处理视觉信息方面的优势主要局限于与棋局相关的刺激。Unterrainer 等人在 2011 年的研究中未发现国际象棋技能能够转移到需要规划和执行控制的伦敦塔任务上。这些研究表明，即使是长期的技能训练，其对于认知能力的影响也可能是有限的，尤其是在远离训练领域的任务上。

The literature on video game expertise and cognitive abilities is relatively large (for reviews, see Boot, Blakely, & Simons, 2011; Ferguson, 2007; Latham, Patston, & Tippett, 2013). Many of these studies have focused on possible transfer effects on visual tasks, such as reaction time (RT), visuospatial rotation, visual search, and visual attention tasks. Cross-sectional studies comparing expert video gamers with novices have commonly found superior performance of gamers on such tasks (see, e.g., Bialystok, 2006; Castel, Pratt, & Drummond, 2005; Greenfield, DeWinstanley, Kilpatrick,& Kaye, 1994; West, Stevens, Pun, & Pratt, 2008; Yuji, 1996), and Ferguson (2007) found a meta-analytic pooled correlation of r  .36 between violent video game playing and measures of visuospatial cognition. As for chess and music, results of longitudinal studies are inconsistent, with both positive findings and null effects of interventions (Boot et al., 2011; Latham et al., 2013), and the meta-analysis by Ferguson indicates the presence of a publication bias. One can note that Sims and Mayer (2002), in a carefully designed study, found—entirely in line with predictions from expertise research—that skilled Tetris players outperform nonplayers on visuospatial rotation tasks that involve Tetris pieces, or highly similar visual shapes, but not on other spatial tests (Experiment 1); furthermore, no transfer effects of Tetris training on spatial ability were found in a longitudinal follow-up study (Experiment 2). In a recent study Gobet et al. (2014) found no effects of video game expertise on an attention task (the Eriksen Flanker Compatibility Task), nor on a visual change detection task.

关于视频游戏专长与认知能力之间的联系，已有相对丰富的文献资料（参考 Boot, Blakely, & Simons, 2011; Ferguson, 2007; Latham, Patston, & Tippett, 2013 等综述）。许多研究聚焦于视频游戏是否可能对视觉任务（如反应时间、视觉空间旋转、视觉搜索及视觉注意力任务）产生转移效应。与新手相比，对专业游戏玩家的横断面研究普遍发现他们在这些任务上表现更佳（例如，参见 Bialystok, 2006; Castel, Pratt, & Drummond, 2005 等），Ferguson（2007）的元分析也显示，暴力视频游戏玩耍与视觉空间认知能力之间存在中等程度的正相关（r 约为.36）。与国际象棋和音乐领域的研究类似，纵向研究结果并不一致，既有积极结果也有干预效果不显著的情况（Boot 等，2011；Latham 等，2013），而 Ferguson 的元分析指出了存在出版偏倚的问题。值得一提的是，Sims 和 Mayer（2002）的研究 —— 完全符合专业研究的预期 —— 发现熟练的俄罗斯方块玩家在涉及俄罗斯方块或相似形状的视觉空间旋转任务上表现优于非玩家，但在其他空间测试上未见效果。最近的一项研究（Gobet 等，2014）则发现，视频游戏专长对注意力任务（Eriksen Flanker 兼容性任务）或视觉变化检测任务没有影响。

“Brain games” designed to increase WM capacity typically include extensive practice of various WM tasks in which the difficulty level changes adaptively during training. Many largescale studies demonstrate that such training improves performance on the trained tasks (Klingberg, 2010; Shinaver, Entwistle, & Söderqvist, 2014), but the extent to which the training also gives far transfer to other contexts is highly controversial. A detailed discussion of these disagreements is beyond the scope of the present review, but we note that several recent reviews and metaanalyses have found little evidence for broad transfer of WM training (Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013; Rapport, Orban, Kofler, & Friedman, 2013; Shipstead, Hicks, & Engle, 2012). However, for a different interpretation of the literature, see, for example, Shinaver et al. (2014). In any case, it appears evident that the acquisition of relatively narrow task-specific expertise is one important mechanism underlying performance improvement in WM training tasks, as in other forms of skill learning (Ericsson et al., 1980; Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, 2012). In line with this, performance in visuospatial WM tasks depends not just on WM capacity as typically operationalized (i.e., the number of stimuli to be remembered) but also on the spatial pattern of the stimuli (Nutley, Söderqvist, Bryde, Humphreys, & Klingberg, 2010) and their familiarity, i.e., previous exposure to the same stimuli (Moore, Cohen, & Ranganath, 2006; Zimmer, Popp, Reith, & Krick, 2012).

旨在提升工作记忆容量的「大脑游戏」通常包括对不同工作记忆任务的大量练习，难度级别会根据训练进度适应性调整。许多大规模研究证明，这种训练确实能提升在特定任务上的表现（例如，Klingberg, 2010；Shinaver 等，2014），但是这种训练是否能够对其他背景下的任务产生远程转移效应，这一点存在较大争议。尽管这里不便详细讨论这些分歧，但近期的几项综述和元分析显示，工作记忆训练的广泛转移证据较少（例如，Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013；Rapport 等，2013；Shipstead 等，2012）。然而，对于文献的不同解读，Shinaver 等人（2014）提供了另一种观点。无论如何，显而易见的是，获取特定任务的狭窄专长是工作记忆训练任务中性能改进的重要机制，如同其他形式的技能学习（Ericsson 等，1980；Shipstead 等，2012）。这与视觉空间工作记忆任务的表现不仅仅依赖于传统意义上的工作记忆容量（即需要记忆的刺激数量），还依赖于刺激的空间排列（Nutley 等，2010）和对刺激的熟悉度（即之前对相同刺激的暴露情况）（Moore 等，2006；Zimmer 等，2012）是一致的。

### 02. Challenges to Deliberate Practice Theory

The literature summarized in the previous section illustrates that research on expert performance and its relation to deliberate practice has advanced scientific understanding of expertise and skill learning in important ways. Nevertheless, recent research has seriously challenged the central tenets of the expert performance framework. In short, deliberate practice theory appears incompatible with the findings of a growing number of studies, which show that variables other than deliberate practice are highly relevant to expert performance. We will now turn to these data.

前一节概述的文献揭示了，专家表现及其与刻意练习之间关系的研究在深化我们对专业技能与技能学习认识方面做出了重要贡献。然而，最新的研究成果对「专家表现理论」的核心观点提出了严峻的质疑。简单来说，随着越来越多研究的发现，刻意练习理论与这些新发现之间似乎存在不一致性，这些研究表明，影响专家表现的因素远不止刻意练习一项。接下来，我们将探讨这些新的数据。

#### 2.1 Practice, Traits, and Expertise: Phenotypic Studies

How much variance in expert performance is actually explained by deliberate practice? An obvious prediction of deliberate practice theory is that individual differences in deliberate practice should be highly correlated with measures of expert performance. Indeed, Ericsson et al. (1993) claimed that “individual differences in ultimate performance can largely be accounted for by differential amounts of past and current levels of practice” (p. 392, italics added). Because the theory actually implies that, with the exception of certain sports in which height and body size play an obvious role, deliberate practice is the only variable of importance for expert performance (Ericsson et al., 1993), it would be tempting to conclude that we should predict not just a high, but a more or less perfect, correlation. However, in reality, neither deliberate practice nor expert performance can be measured with perfect reliability. Nevertheless, even a liberal reading of the deliberate practice theory leads to the minimal prediction that most of the variance in expert performance should be explained by deliberate practice, taking measurement error into account.

刻意练习究竟在多大程度上能解释专家水平表现的差异呢？刻意练习理论的直接预期是，个人在刻意练习上的差异应与专家水平表现的测量紧密相关。Ericsson 等人在 1993 年的研究中甚至声称，「个体最终表现的差异主要可以通过不同的过去和当前练习量来解释」（第 392 页，斜体强调）。这个理论实际上意味着，在除了身高和体型在某些运动中起决定性作用之外，刻意练习是影响专家表现的唯一重要因素，这让人不禁认为，我们应该预期一个非常高甚至近乎完美的相关性。然而，现实是，无论刻意练习还是专家表现都无法达到完美的测量准确性。即便如此，即使是较为宽泛地理解刻意练习理论，也会预期绝大多数专家表现的差异应由刻意练习解释，同时还要考虑到测量误差。

The available evidence does not support this prediction. A number of recent reviews and meta-analyses have provided estimates of the proportion of variance in expert performance explained by deliberate practice in different domains (Hambrick, Oswald, et al., 2014; Macnamara et al., 2014; Platz et al., 2014).

但是，现有证据并不支持这一预期。最近的一些综述和元分析评估了刻意练习在不同领域解释专家表现差异的比例（Hambrick, Oswald 等人，2014; Macnamara 等人，2014; Platz 等人，2014）。这些研究表明，除了刻意练习外，还有其他因素在专家表现中起着重要作用。

The estimates range from less than 1% for professional expertise in Macnamara et al. (2014), to 36% for music in Platz et al. (2014). Another important finding was that correlations between deliberate practice and expert performance varied systematically with certain moderator variables as well as between domains (Macnamara et al., 2014). Expert performance in games and music showed the strongest relation to practice. Predictable tasks showed a relatively strong relation to deliberate practice, whereas more unpredictable tasks showed a weaker relationship. Furthermore, in striking con-trast to predictions from the expert performance framework (Ericsson et al., 1993; Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996), relations were stronger for retrospective estimates of deliberate practice than for deliberate practice logs, which presumably yield more valid estimates of deliberate practice, and when professional status or ranking was used as an index of expertise than when experimental measures of expert performance were used (Macnamara et al., 2014).

研究显示，刻意练习对专家表现的解释能力差异很大，从 Macnamara 等人（2014）研究中对专业专长不足 1% 的解释，到 Platz 等人（2014）对音乐领域达 36% 的解释。一个关键的发现是，刻意练习与专家表现之间的关系，不仅在不同领域之间存在显著差异，而且还受到特定调节变量的影响（Macnamara 等人，2014）。例如，游戏和音乐领域的专家表现与练习的关联最为紧密。相对于不可预测的任务，可预测性任务与刻意练习之间的关系更为密切。值得注意的是，这与专家表现框架的预期相反，基于回顾性估计的刻意练习与专家表现之间的关系比基于刻意练习日志的关系更强，后者本应提供更准确的刻意练习评估。而且，当使用职业状态或排名作为专家水平的指标时，比起使用专家表现的实验测量方法，相关性更强（Macnamara 等人，2014）。

This evidence converges on two conclusions. First, relations between retrospective practice estimates and expertise may be inflated, for example, because participants’ perceptions of their current ability and achievements influence their estimates of earlier practice. Second, experimental measures of—inevitably limitedaspects of expert performance may not be more valid measures than ratings or group membership, which could be based on a more global and balanced assessment of the totality of skills needed in a domain. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that expert performance depends also on other factors than deliberate practice. In the next section, we review the literature on what some of these factors may be.

这些发现引出两个重要结论。首先，基于回顾的练习估计与专业技能之间的联系可能被高估了，部分原因可能是因为参与者对他们自身当前能力和成就的感知影响了他们对过去练习量的回忆。其次，实验测量专家表现的有效性可能不如评级或群体归属这样的指标，后者基于对所需技能整体的更全面评估。这些观察强烈暗示，除了刻意练习外，还有其他因素对专家表现有重要影响。接下来，我们将探讨这些其他因素可能包括哪些。

Expert performance and physical traits. Even the staunchest proponents of deliberate practice have consistently allowed for one exception to the deliberate practice theory, namely, that in certain sports, the physical traits of body size and height may influence expert performance over and above deliberate practice (Ericsson, 2007, 2014c; Ericsson et al., 1993). The importance of height for sports like high jumping and basketball is indeed self-evident. In reality, however, there are many anthropometric variables that influence biomechanical body properties of relevance for physical expert performance (Epstein, 2013). Energy economy during running is related to body height, as well as ponderal index, physique, and morphology of the feet, the legs, and the pelvis (Anderson, 1996). Runners tend to have longer legs than swimmers, and the size of the upper extremities matters for sports like handball. For example, Debanne and Laffaye (2011) found that ball throwing velocity is substantially correlated with both general anthropometric properties such as height and body mass (r  .55 to .70), and handball-specific anthropometric properties such as arm span and hand size (r  .35 to .51).

即便是刻意练习理论最坚定的拥护者也承认，在特定的运动项目中，运动员的身体特征，如身高和体型，可能会对其专业表现产生决定性影响，超越了刻意练习的作用（Ericsson, 2007, 2014c; Ericsson et al., 1993）。例如，在高跳和篮球等运动中，运动员的身高优势显而易见。然而，实际上，更多的人体测量学变量，如与体能表现密切相关的生物力学特性，也会影响专家水平的表现（Epstein, 2013）。例如，跑步的能量效率与身高、体型指数、以及脚、腿和骨盆的形状有关（Anderson, 1996）。通常，跑步者相比游泳者拥有更长的腿部，而在手球等运动中，上肢的尺寸则显得尤为重要。Debanne 和 Laffaye（2011）的研究发现，球的投掷速度与身高、体重等一般人体测量特性（r 在.55 到.70 之间），以及手球特有的人体测量特性如臂展和手部尺寸（r 在.35 到.51 之间）显著相关。

Anthropometric properties are also of importance for other expert performance that involves physical activity, such as music performance and dancing. Dancers specializing in dances with different functional requirements show characteristic group differences in height and somatotype (Liiv et al., 2013). Hand morphology influences dexterity in pianists, and a small hand makes it difficult to play wide chords and increases the risk for overuse disorders (Sakai & Shimawaki, 2010; Wagner, 1988).

人体测量特性对于其他涉及身体活动的专业表现同样重要，比如音乐演出和舞蹈。专攻不同舞蹈风格的舞者在身高和体型上存在显著的群体差异（Liiv et al., 2013）。手部形态会影响钢琴家的手指灵活度，小手的钢琴家在弹奏宽和弦时会遇到困难，且更容易出现过度使用的疾病（Sakai & Shimawaki, 2010; Wagner, 1988）。这些研究强调了在评估专业表现时，除了刻意练习外，身体特征的重要性不容忽视。

Critically from the standpoint of evaluating deliberate practice theory, anthropometric variables are strongly influenced by genetic factors, with heritabilities typically in the range 70% to 90% for measures like body height (Silventoinen, Magnusson, Tynelius, Kaprio, & Rasmussen, 2008; Silventoinen et al., 2003), arm and finger lengths (Poveda, Jelenkovic, Susanne, & Rebato, 2010), length of the eye (Kim et al., 2013; Lyhne, Sjølie, Kyvik, & Green, 2001), and head size (Smit et al., 2010). In principle, a high heritability does not imply that a trait cannot be modified by environmental interventions, but we are aware of no empirical demonstrations that deliberate practice has significant effects on physical traits that reflect the dimensions of hard tissue, such as height or the length and proportions of the extremities.

从刻意练习理论评估的视角来看，遗传因素对于人体测量学变量如身高、手臂和手指长度、眼睛长度及头部大小的强烈影响是不可忽视的，这些变量的遗传率通常在 70% 到 90% 之间（Silventoinen 等人，2008; Silventoinen 等人，2003; Poveda 等人，2010; Kim 等人，2013; Smit 等人，2010）。尽管高遗传率并不意味着环境干预无法改变某些特征，但目前尚无实证证据显示刻意练习能显著改变那些反映硬组织维度的身体特征，如身高或四肢的长度和比例。

Expert performance and cognitive ability. The claim that cognitive abilities do not limit expert performance is a particularly controversial claim of deliberate practice theory, given the strong theoretical reasons to expect the opposite. First, one of the most well-established findings in psychology is that the general factor of intelligence—psychometric g—correlates with learning, especially in cognitively demanding tasks (Ackerman, 1996; Ackerman & Cianciolo, 2000; Jensen, 1998). Deliberate practice is, by definition, explicit and characterized by a conscious search for strategies to improve performance (Ericsson, 2007). In other words, deliberate practice requires sustained attention and metacognition, both of which are correlated with intelligence (Schweizer & Moosbrugger, 2004; Schweizer, Moosbrugger, & Goldhammer, 2005; Stankov, 2000). Regardless of the mechanisms underlying this correlation, one might thus expect that engagement in deliberate practice is more correlated with intelligence than less deliberate forms of practice.

专家表现与认知能力之间的关系更是刻意练习理论中一个颇受争议的论点，特别是当强有力的理论基础预示着相反的结论时。首先，心理学中一个非常确定的发现是，智力的通用因素 —— 心理测量 g —— 与学习能力相关，尤其是在认知要求较高的任务中（Ackerman, 1996; Ackerman & Cianciolo, 2000; Jensen, 1998）。刻意练习本质上是一种显性行为，它特征在于有意寻找提升表现的策略（Ericsson, 2007）。换言之，刻意练习需要持续的注意力和元认知能力，而这两者都与智力紧密相关（Schweizer & Moosbrugger, 2004; Schweizer, Moosbrugger, & Goldhammer, 2005; Stankov, 2000）。因此，可以合理预期，与智力相比，参与刻意练习的程度可能与智力有更强的相关性，而不是那些较少涉及刻意练习的行为。这些讨论强调了在考虑专家表现时，认知能力和遗传因素的重要性，挑战了刻意练习理论的某些核心观点。

Second, many forms of expert performance are intrinsically unpredictable and involve online processing of novel information, even at high levels of expertise. Such tasks are presumably difficult to optimize through the processes of automation, chunking, and efficient WM–LTM interactions, discussed previously, and could, for that reason, be highly dependent on intelligence and executive control. Finally, intelligence shows weak to moderate correlations with RT (r  .3 to .5; Deary, Der, & Ford, 2001; Jensen, 2006), processing speed (r  .3 to .5; Neubauer & Knorr, 1998; Rindermann & Neubauer, 2004), and temporal and nontemporal sensory discrimination (r  .2 to .5; Spearman, C. (1904); Rammsayer & Brandler, 2007; Troche & Rammsayer, 2009)basic capacities that appear likely to be important for expert performance in many domains.

智力在许多形式的专家表现中发挥关键作用，尤其是在那些本质上不可预测且涉及实时处理新颖信息的任务中。这些任务难以通过自动化、信息分块和工作记忆与长期记忆间的高效互动来优化，因此可能极度依赖智力和执行控制功能。此外，智力与反应时间（Deary, Der, & Ford, 2001; Jensen, 2006）、处理速度（Neubauer & Knorr, 1998; Rindermann & Neubauer, 2004）以及感觉辨别能力（Spearman, C. (1904); Rammsayer & Brandler, 2007; Troche & Rammsayer, 2009）呈现出从弱到中等的相关性 —— 这些基本能力对于许多专业领域的专家表现显得至关重要。

Consistent with these observations, growing evidence indicates that expert performance is indeed related to cognitive ability. A large literature shows that intelligence predicts educational achievement, an outcome that is obviously related to the acquisition of expertise (e.g., in reading and arithmetic). Correlations between educational achievement and IQ typically fall in the range r  .4 to .7 (Deary, Strand, Smith, & Fernandes, 2007; Krapohl et al., 2014). Intelligence is also correlated with occupation and performance in the workplace. The mean IQ of employees is higher in occupations with higher demands on complex information processing and cognitive skills (Gottfredson, 2003; Hunt, 2011), and a meta-analysis by F. L. Schmidt and Hunter (1998) found general mental ability to predict individual differences in job performance, with a mean validity of .63. Furthermore, as illustrated by findings from the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth project (Lubinski & Benbow, 2006), expert performance and achievement are predicted by differences in cognitive ability, even within the highest percentile. Recent findings from this research show that, for example, participants who scored at or above the 99.99th percentile on the verbal or mathematical SAT before Age 13 display outstanding achievements as adults within a broad range of expertise domains that include science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, as well as the arts, business, and law (Kell, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2013). The domains of expertise vary with ability profile, so that high scorers on the verbal SAT tend to excel within arts, humanities, and writing, whereas high scorers on the mathematical SAT display top achievements within STEM fields (Kell et al., 2013).

与这些观察结果一致的是，越来越多的证据表明，专家表现实际上与认知能力有关。大量文献表明智力预测教育成就，后者显然与专业技能的获得密切相关（例如，阅读和算术）。教育成就与智商之间的相关性通常在 0.4 到 0.7 之间（Deary, Strand, Smith, & Fernandes, 2007; Krapohl et al., 2014）。智力还与职业选择和工作场所的表现相关联。在对复杂信息处理和认知技能要求更高的职业中，员工的平均智商较高（Gottfredson, 2003; Hunt, 2011），F. L. Schmidt 和 Hunter（1998）的元分析发现，一般心理能力能预测工作表现中的个体差异，平均效度为 0.63。此外，数学天才青年研究项目的发现（Lubinski & Benbow, 2006）进一步证明了，在最高百分位范围内，认知能力差异预测了专家表现和成就。最近的研究成果显示，在 13 岁前在 SAT 言语或数学部分得分在 99.99 百分位以上的参与者，在成人后在科学、技术、工程、数学（STEM）领域以及艺术、商业和法律等广泛专业领域取得了杰出成就（Kell, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2013）。专业领域的成就与能力轮廓有关，例如，SAT 言语部分高分者往往在艺术、人文和写作方面表现出色，而数学部分高分者则在 STEM 领域取得了顶尖成就（Kell et al., 2013）。这些发现强调了认知能力对于专家表现的重要性，挑战了刻意练习理论中认为认知能力不限制专家表现的观点。

In contrast, studies on the relation between study time and grade point average have found surprisingly weak effects (Plant, Ericsson, Hill, & Asberg, 2005), and the meta-analysis of Macnamara et al. (2014) found that deliberate practice, on average, predicted only 4% of the variance in expert performance in educational contexts.

研究显示，与学习时间和平均绩点（GPA）之间的关系相比，刻意练习对于教育背景下专家表现的解释效果出奇地弱（Plant 等，2005），Macnamara 等人（2014）的元分析更是发现，刻意练习平均仅能解释教育背景下专家表现变异的 4%。

The contributions of intelligence and deliberate practice to expert performance have also been assessed in studies that include more direct measures of expert performance or skill level. Null effects of cognitive abilities on expert performance in experts have been reported for predictable tasks such as typing (Keith & Ericsson, 2007). In contrast, IQ predicts performance in chess experts: Grabner, Stern, and Neubauer (2007) found a correlation of r  .35 between general intelligence and Elo rating in Austrian tournament chess players. Meinz and Hambrick (2010) found a partial correlation of r  .37 between WM capacity and sight-reading ability in musicians, after controlling for deliberate practice. In line with these findings, Ackerman (1987) has argued that the associations between cognitive abilities and performance, at different stages of training, should depend strongly on how demanding the task is in terms of attentional resources, and whether it is consistent or predictable enough to be efficiently automated during training. For attention-demanding tasks that are difficult to automate, this framework predicts that significant correlations between cognitive ability and performance should remain after practice; support for this was indeed found in reanalyses of several classical datasets from Thorndike, Woodrow, Fleishman, and others (Ackerman, 1987). Later studies have corroborated that correlations between performance and intelligence remain and may even increase during several hours of training of complex, low-predictability tasks (Ackerman, 2014; Ackerman & Cianciolo, 2000).

在包括更直接衡量专家表现或技能水平的研究中，智力和刻意练习对专家表现的贡献也得到了评估。在可预测的任务（如打字）中，研究报告认知能力对专家表现没有影响（Keith & Ericsson, 2007）。然而，在国际象棋这样的领域，智力确实能预测专家表现：Grabner, Stern, 和 Neubauer（2007）在奥地利锦标赛国际象棋选手中发现，智力与 Elo 等级之间的相关性为 r  .35。Meinz 和 Hambrick（2010）在控制刻意练习后，发现工作记忆容量与音乐家的视奏能力之间的偏相关性为 r  .37。这些发现支持 Ackerman（1987）的观点，即认知能力与表现之间的关联，在训练的不同阶段，强烈依赖于任务对注意力资源的需求，以及任务是否足够一致或可预测，以便在训练期间进行有效的自动化。对于那些难以自动化且需求高度注意力的任务，即使在经过刻意练习之后，认知能力与表现之间的显著相关性仍然存在；Ackerman 在对 Thorndike、Woodrow、Fleishman 等人的经典数据集重新分析后发现了这一点的支持。后续研究进一步证实，在训练复杂、可预测性低的任务数小时后，表现与智力之间的相关性不仅保持不变，甚至可能增加（Ackerman, 2014; Ackerman & Cianciolo, 2000）。这些研究结果强调了在专家表现中，认知能力的重要性，挑战了刻意练习能完全解释专家表现的观点。

Expert performance and personality. There are several reasons to expect relations between expert performance and personality. First, personality—which is moderately related to vocational interests (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Harris, Vernon, Johnson, & Jang, 2006; Holland, 1997; McKay & Tokar, 2012)—is likely to influence which domain an individual chooses to become an expert in. Second, personality could impact both amount and quality of practice. Third, personality may even have a direct influence on expert performance, independent of deliberate practice, in certain domains. For example, extraversion could influence expert performance in stage arts, and personality traits related to emotional competence could play a role for expert performance in domains that involve a high degree of interpersonal interaction (e.g., psychotherapy).

专家表现与个性之间的关系引起了研究者的关注。首先，个性与职业兴趣有中等程度的关系，这可能决定了个体选择哪个领域成为专家。其次，个性可能对练习的数量和质量产生影响。第三，个性在某些领域甚至可能直接影响专家表现，独立于刻意练习，例如，在舞台艺术中的外向性，或在需要高度人际交往的领域中与情感能力相关的个性特征（如心理治疗）。

The few relevant studies in the literature suggest that personality is indeed related to deliberate practice. Grit, a personality variable reflecting a persistence in pursuing long-term goals that is strongly (r  .77) correlated with conscientiousness (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, & Kelly, 2007), predicted deliberate practice (r  .30) and performance (r  .17) in a spelling competition for children, whereas openness did not (Duckworth, Kirby, Tsukayama, Berstein, & Ericsson, 2011). In contrast, Butkovic, Ullén, and Mosing (2015) found voluntary music practice to be predicted by openness (r  .31) and a proneness to experience psychological flow during musical activities (r  .46; see also McPherson & McCormick, 1999; Smith, 2005). In a study of chess players, Grabner et al. (2007) found associations between playing strength and personality measures reflecting domain-specific performance motivation and emotion expression control (r  .27 to .39). As another example, Miksza (2011) found impulsivity in musicians to be related to less-well-organized practice and poorer achievement with correlations in the range r  .2 to .4 between impulsivity and practicing behaviors involving repetition.

目前的研究表明，个性确实与刻意练习相关。例如，坚毅这一个性特质，它反映了追求长期目标的持久性，并与责任感密切相关（r 约为.77），被发现可以预测刻意练习（r 约为.30）以及儿童拼写比赛中的表现（r 约为.17），而开放性则没有这样的预测作用。相反，Butkovic, Ullén, 和 Mosing（2015）发现，音乐练习的自愿性被开放性（r 约为.31）和在音乐活动中体验心流的倾向（r 约为.46）所预测。在国际象棋选手的研究中，发现了表现力与反映领域特定表现动机和情绪表达控制的个性测量之间的关系（r 在.27 到.39 之间）。Miksza（2011）在音乐家中发现，冲动性与组织不良的练习和较差的成就相关，冲动性与练习行为（涉及重复）之间的相关性在 r 在 -.2 到 -.4 之间。这些研究结果表明，个性不仅影响个体选择成为哪个领域的专家，还可能通过影响练习的方式和直接影响专家表现的机制，对专家表现产生重要影响。

There is also evidence that personality influences expert performance, above and beyond deliberate practice. In particular, largescale studies by Ackerman and colleagues have demonstrated how correlations between vocational interests, personality, and abilities form different “trait complexes,” with different personality profiles of individuals active in different domains (social, scientific, clerical, cultural; Ackerman, 1996; Ackerman, Chamorro-Premuzic, & Furnham, 2011; Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997).

研究发现，个人的性格特质不仅能够影响他们的专业技能表现，这种影响甚至超越了刻意训练的效果。Ackerman 和他的团队通过大型研究揭示了职业兴趣、个性和能力之间的关联，这些因素共同形成了不同的「特质复合体」。根据他们的发现，不同领域（如社会、科学、文书、文化等）中的专业人士展现出各自独特的个性概况（Ackerman, 1996; Ackerman, Chamorro-Premuzic, & Furnham, 2011; Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997）。

Genetic influences on deliberate practice, expert performance, and associated traits. Given that most complex traits, including those associated with expert performance, such as personality, interests, and cognitive abilities, have been shown to be partly heritable, it is reasonable to also expect some genetic influences on variation in expert performance (Bouchard & McGue, 2003; Harris et al., 2006; Poldermann et al., 2015; Plomin & Spinath, 2004). Moreover, as summarized earlier, expertise critically depends on neural plasticity. Experts and nonexperts show extensive differences in regional brain anatomy in both the gray and the white matter. Animal data supports that macroanatomical effects of long-term training in part reflect formation of new neuronal processes and synapses (see, e.g., Kleim et al., 2004). Functional reorganizations in experts include both altered functional properties of specific brain regions and changes in connectivity between regions—adaptations that presumably serve to optimize the processing of domain-specific information.

至于刻意练习、专家水平表现及其相关特质的遗传因素，有足够的理由相信，鉴于大多数与专家表现相关的复杂特质（比如个性、兴趣和认知能力）都显示出部分遗传性，专家表现的差异也可能受到基因的影响（Bouchard & McGue, 2003; Harris et al., 2006; Poldermann et al., 2015; Plomin & Spinath, 2004）。此外，正如之前提到的，专业技能的发展在很大程度上依赖于大脑的可塑性。通过研究，专家与非专家在大脑的灰质和白质区域结构上存在显著差异。动物实验数据表明，长期训练对大脑宏观结构的影响，实际上反映了新的神经细胞过程和突触的形成（例如，见 Kleim et al., 2004）。专家在特定脑区的功能属性以及区域间连接性上的改变，这些功能重组似乎都是为了更有效地处理特定领域的信息。

The animal literature is replete with evidence for the importance of genetic factors for neural plasticity, many of which appear to be highly conserved through the animal kingdom (Frank & Fossella, 2011). In light of this, it would be most surprising to find that genetic factors played no role for the acquisition of expert performance. Indeed, recent twin studies have confirmed substantial genetic effects on music practice (Hambrick & Tucker-Drob, 2015; Mosing, Madison, et al., 2014) as well as self-rated expertise (Vinkhuyzen, van der Sluis, Posthuma, & Boomsma, 2009). Furthermore, genetic pleiotropy is a major mechanism behind associations between openness, psychological flow experiences during musical activities, and music practice (Butkovic et al., 2015), as well as between intelligence and music practice (Mosing et al., 2015).

动物界的研究充分证明了遗传因素在神经可塑性中的重要作用，这些因素在整个动物界中被高度保留（Frank & Fossella, 2011）。因此，如果我们发现遗传因素对专家级技能的习得没有任何贡献，那将非常令人意外。实际上，近期的双胞胎研究已经明确显示音乐练习（Hambrick & Tucker-Drob, 2015; Mosing, Madison, 等，2014）以及自我评价的专业技能（Vinkhuyzen, van der Sluis, Posthuma, & Boomsma, 2009）都受到显著的遗传影响。此外，遗传多效性是连接开放性、音乐活动中的心理流体验和音乐练习（Butkovic et al., 2015），以及智力和音乐练习（Mosing et al., 2015）之间的主要桥梁。

Behavior genetic studies have also shed light on the nature of phenotypic associations between practice and performance. Musical aptitude is influenced by genetic factors (Drayna, Manichaikul, de Lange, Snieder, & Spector, 2001; Oikkonen et al., 2015; Ukkola-Vuoti et al., 2013), and Mosing, Madison, et al. (2014) found genetic pleiotropy to be the major factor behind associations between music practice and musical aptitude. This was supported by two analyses. First, the results of a monozygotic intrapair difference (cotwin control) design showed that the phenotypic relation between practice and ability (r  .15) disappeared entirely when controlling for both genetic factors and shared environment. Furthermore, bivariate classical twin modeling suggested that the association was essentially driven by common genes, that is, pleiotropy. These results thus speak strongly against a causal effect of practice on musical perceptual ability. Similarly, Ullén, Mosing, and Madison (2015) recently reported that the association between music practice and accuracy of motor timing disappears when controlling for genetics and shared environment. Furthermore, Hambrick and Tucker-Drob (2015) reported common genetic effects on musical practice and achievement, and found indications that the importance of genetic factors for musical achievementcontrary to predictions from the deliberate practice theory—increased with practice. This is line with a twin study on training of the rotary pursuit task, which found genetic influences on performance as well as rate of learning, with an increased heritability of performance after three days of training (Fox, Hershberger, & Bouchard, 1996).

行为遗传学的研究也揭开了练习与表现之间表型联系的本质。音乐才能受到遗传因素的影响（Drayna, Manichaikul, de Lange, Snieder, & Spector, 2001; Oikkonen et al., 2015; Ukkola-Vuoti et al., 2013），而 Mosing, Madison 等人（2014）的研究发现，音乐练习与音乐天赋之间的联系主要由遗传多效性解释。这一点通过两项分析得到了支持。首先，通过比较同卵双胞胎之间的差异，发现一旦考虑到遗传因素和共同环境的影响，练习与能力之间的关系完全消失。此外，双变量双胞胎模型分析表明，这种联系主要是由共有的基因决定的，即遗传多效性。这些发现强烈表明，练习对音乐感知能力并没有因果影响。同样，Ullén, Mosing, 和 Madison（2015）的研究也表明，当控制了遗传因素和共享环境后，音乐练习与运动定时准确性之间的联系也消失了。而 Hambrick 和 Tucker-Drob（2015）的报告则显示，音乐练习与成就之间存在共同的遗传影响，并且随着练习的增加，遗传因素对音乐成就的重要性 —— 与刻意练习理论的预期相反 —— 实际上增加了。这与旋转追踪任务训练的双胞胎研究结果一致，该研究发现遗传因素不仅影响表现，而且还影响学习速度，经过三天训练后，表现的遗传性有所增加（Fox, Hershberger, & Bouchard, 1996）。

### 03. Rethinking Expertise 

#### 3.1 Deliberate Practice Theory and Recent Empirical Challenges

Criticisms of the extreme claims of deliberate practice theory are not new and have, on several occasions, been highlighted in published exchanges focusing on various aspects of the expert performance framework, including the question of innate talent (see Howe et al., 1998, with commentaries), the relative importance of deliberate practice and other variables for expert performance (Detterman, 2014; Hambrick, Altmann, Oswald, Meinz, & Gobet, 2014; Hambrick, Oswald, et al., 2014; Platz et al., 2014), and giftedness (see Ericsson et al., 2007a, with commentaries). We would like to emphasize that—as pointed out by philosopher of science Imre Lakatos (1978)—it is essential to evaluate a model in terms of how well it can explain major findings in a field, taken together, and how fruitful it is in terms of generating new hypotheses. In any complex field, unpredicted results of individual experiments can usually easily be made compatible with a theory, using one ad hoc explanation or another (Lakatos, 1978). We believe, therefore, that it is instructive and revealing to briefly examine a few of the more common themes in recent debates on deliberate practice theory, keeping these observations in mind.

长期以来，对刻意练习理论的极端主张一直存在争议，这些争议不仅涵盖了专家表现框架的多个方面，例如天赋的角色（如 Howe 等人在 1998 年的研究及其评论中所讨论的）、刻意练习与其他因素在专家表现中的相对重要性（如 Detterman 在 2014 年的研究）、以及天才的本质（如 Ericsson 等人在 2007 年的研究及其评论中所讨论的）。正如科学哲学家 Imre Lakatos 在 1978 年指出的那样，评估一个理论模型的重要性在于其解释领域内主要发现的能力，以及它产生新假设的能力。在复杂领域中，理论通常可以通过某种特定的解释来兼容单个实验的不预期结果（Lakatos, 1978）。因此，回顾刻意练习理论近期辩论中一些常见主题，考虑到这些观点，是非常有启示性和揭示性的。

First, as detailed in the previous section, meta-analyses demonstrate that deliberate practice fails to account for all, nearly all, or even most of the variance in expert performance, and often even explains only a surprisingly small proportion of the total variance. A common objection to such findings is to question the study’s validity, and more specifically, to suggest that the participants did not engage in sufficiently deliberate practice that and/or the employed practice measure did not tap deliberate practice unambiguously enough (Ericsson, 2014b, 2014c; Ericsson, Roring, & Nandagopal, 2007b). This argument may appear circular—deliberate practice explains expert performance, and if the data show something else, the practice was not real deliberate practice—but of course the point would be completely valid if there were a general agreement on exactly which activities qualify as deliberate practice in various domains, as well as solid data showing that deliberate practice, with this definition, predicts expert performance, whereas other forms of practice do not. However, the distinction between deliberate practice and other forms of practice is in reality often very unclear (Howard, 2009). Furthermore, there is abundant ev-idence showing that forms of domain-relevant experience other than deliberate practice lead to improvements of performance, and that the optimal practice style can vary depending on personality (Howard, 2009, 2012; Kluge, Ritzmann, Burkolter, & Sauer, 2011). In fact, entirely implicit forms of learning from experience and exposure are important, for example, for the acquisition of linguistic expertise (Forkstam & Petersson, 2005; Perruchet & Pacton, 2006). Finally, there is evidence from chess that number of games played—a domain-related activity that cannot be regarded as solitary deliberate practice in any sense of the term—is a strong predictor of skill level (Howard, 2012).

首先，正如之前部分所述，元分析显示刻意练习并不能解释专家表现中所有或大多数的差异，并且有时甚至只能解释总差异中一个意外的小部分。对这些发现的常见反应是质疑研究的有效性，具体来说，是质疑参与者是否进行了足够的、明确的刻意练习（如 Ericsson 在 2014 年的论述）。这种论点可能看起来有点自圆其说 —— 如果数据与刻意练习解释专家表现的观点不符，那么所进行的就不是真正的刻意练习。然而，如果大家对于哪些活动属于刻意练习达成共识，并且有确凿数据显示刻意练习（根据这一定义）可以预测专家表现而其他练习形式则不行，这个观点就完全站得住脚。不过，实际上刻意练习与其他练习形式之间的界限往往非常模糊（Howard, 2009）。更重要的是，大量证据表明，除刻意练习外的领域相关经验也能提升表现，而且最适合的练习方式可能会根据个人性格而有所不同（Howard, 2009, 2012; Kluge 等人，2011 年）。事实上，从经验和接触中进行的完全隐性学习对于获得语言等专业技能至关重要（Forkstam & Petersson, 2005; Perruchet & Pacton, 2006）。最后，国际象棋的研究证明，下棋次数 —— 一种与刻意练习在任何意义上都不相同的领域相关活动 —— 是预测技能水平的强有力指标（Howard, 2012）。

A second common objection is that studies showing modest effects of deliberate practice have ignored effects of injury, disease, and related variables (Ericsson, 2014c). These variables should obviously be considered among the many variables, apart from deliberate practice, that potentially influence expert performance. However, it is important to note that the proportion of variance in expert performance that should be explained by deliberate practice, taking the mentioned variables into account, is not specified by deliberate practice theory. This makes the proposal impossible to evaluate empirically (i.e., to falsify). More importantly, deliberate practice theory provides no plausible explanation for recent empirical findings on this issue, including the systematic differences in deliberate-practice/expert-performance relations between tasks and domains, and their dependence on moderator variables. Deliberate practice theory does not explain why, for example, deliberate practice explains a relatively large proportion of expert performance variance in musicians and athletes—groups highly susceptible to injury and overuse—and a much smaller amount of the variance in domains in which injury and overuse are uncommon, such as professions with minimal physical demands (e.g., sales; see Sonnentag & Kleine, 2000).

第二个经常被提出的批评是，一些研究因忽略了受伤、疾病及其相关变量的影响，而只报告了刻意练习的有限效果（Ericsson, 2014c）。显然，这些因素应被认为是影响专家表现的多个因素之一，除了刻意练习。然而，值得注意的是，考虑到这些因素，刻意练习在解释专家表现的变异中所占比例，并未在刻意练习理论中明确给出。这使得从经验角度对该理论进行评估（即，证伪）变得不可能。更重要的是，面对包括任务和领域间刻意练习与专家表现关系的系统差异以及这些差异对调节变量的依赖等最新的经验发现，刻意练习理论未提供一个合理的解释。例如，刻意练习理论未能解释为何在容易受伤和过度使用的群体，如音乐家和运动员中，刻意练习能解释相对较大的专家表现变异比例，而在受伤和过度使用不常见的领域，如身体要求最小的职业（比如销售），刻意练习所解释的变异量却要小得多（参见 Sonnentag & Kleine, 2000）。

A third recurring controversy is whether tasks that show less impressive correlations with deliberate practice and/or substantial relations to variables other than deliberate practice qualify as true forms of expert performance. One example is musical aptitude, operationalized as the ability to discriminate musical melodies, rhythms, and pitches. This ability is related to intelligence (Lynn & Gault, 1986; Lynn, Wilson, & Gault, 1989) and music practice (Ullén, Mosing, Holm, Eriksson, & Madison, 2014). As already discussed, it has recently been found that these associations are essentially driven by common genetic influences (Mosing, Madison, et al., 2014; Mosing, Pedersen, Madison, & Ullén, 2014). In a recent commentary, Ericsson (2014c) dismisses studies of music discrimination because they “test memory and perception of music rather than music performance” (p. 85). However, the capability to discriminate musical sounds is essential for music performance. Furthermore, musical discrimination is commonly measured in entrance exams to music colleges, and correlates nontrivially with music practice, musician status, and musical achievement (Seashore, 1938; Ullén et al., 2014; Wallentin, Nielsen, Friis-Olivarius, Vuust, & Vuust, 2010). One can note that in other contexts, when expert performance does correlate with deliberate practice but not with professional status, this has been taken not as a challenge to the expert performance paradigm or as evidence that the expert performance task is unrepresentative, but rather as support for that professional status is an unreliable and potentially irrelevant outcome in expertise research (Ericsson, 2014c; Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996).

第三个反复出现的争议涉及到那些与刻意练习的相关性不那么显著或与刻意练习以外的变量有显著联系的任务是否能够被视为真正的专家表现形式。音乐才能的例子，特别是区分音乐旋律、节奏和音高的能力，就是一个例子。这种能力与智力（Lynn & Gault, 1986; Lynn, Wilson, & Gault, 1989）和音乐练习（Ullén, Mosing, Holm, Eriksson, & Madison, 2014）相关。正如前文讨论的，这些关联基本上是由共同的遗传因素驱动的（Mosing, Madison, 等，2014; Mosing, Pedersen, Madison, & Ullén, 2014）。Ericsson（2014c）近期的评论中对音乐区分能力的研究提出批评，认为它们「测试的是对音乐的记忆和感知，而非音乐表演本身」（第 85 页）。然而，音乐声音的区分能力对于音乐表演至关重要。此外，音乐区分能力常在音乐学院的入学考试中被测试，并与音乐练习、音乐家地位和音乐成就有着密切的关联（Seashore, 1938; Ullén 等人，2014; Wallentin, Nielsen, Friis-Olivarius, Vuust, & Vuust, 2010）。值得注意的是，在某些情况下，即使专家表现与刻意练习有关联，但与职业地位无关，这并不被视为挑战专家表现范式或表明专家表现任务不具代表性的证据，而是被认为是支持职业地位在专业知识研究中可能是不可靠和不相关的结果（Ericsson, 2014c; Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996）。

A closely related issue is the question of who does and does not qualify as an expert in a field. Early studies suggested a fairly liberal criterion for expertise, namely, that anyone performing at two standard deviations or more above the mean of the general population on a representative task is an expert (Ericsson & Charness, 1994). This definition regards expertise as one end of a continuous distribution and would—reasonably—imply that many individuals should be considered as experts in various fields. However, as discussed, an important additional characteristic of expertise is that it requires relatively extended periods of training (months or years). An often quoted rule of thumb is that 10 years of practice might be required for “mastery” of a domain (Ericsson & Charness, 1994; Simon & Chase, 1973). Recently, Ericsson (2014c) has gone even further, suggesting that true expertise may only be displayed by “less than a handful of individuals” (p. 100). Unfortunately, these unclear and arbitrary distinctions between more mundane forms of expertise, mastery, and eminence have been utilized to circumvent challenges from studies demonstrating effects of nondeliberate practice variables on expert performance. For instance, Ericsson considers a large-scale study on the top 5% of 8th grade readers—which demonstrates genetic influences on reading expertise (Plomin, Shakeshaft, McMillan, & Trzaskowski, 2014)—as irrelevant, as the studied behavior would not qualify as expert performance. Ericsson even suggests that twin studies are in principle uninformative for expertise research, as too few twins display true expertise to perform behavioral genetic analyses. However, clearly, many twins display expertise by the twostandard-deviation criterion.

关于谁算作某一领域的专家，这个问题紧密相关且值得探讨。早期的研究采用了一个相对宽泛的标准来定义专家，即任何人只要在某个具有代表性的任务上的表现比普通人群的平均水平高出两个标准差或更多，就可以被认为是专家（Ericsson & Charness, 1994）。这种定义把专家看作是能力连续分布中的一个极端，并合理地认为，在各种领域中，许多个体都应被视为专家。然而，正如所讨论的，成为专家还有一个重要的附加条件 —— 需要较长时间的训练，通常是数月甚至数年。有一个广为人知的经验规则是，掌握一个领域可能需要 10 年的实践（Ericsson & Charness, 1994; Simon & Chase, 1973）。近期，Ericsson（2014c）进一步强调，真正的专家可能仅限于「少数几人」（第 100 页）。不幸的是，这种模糊和主观的区分标准，比如专家、精通和卓越之间的区别，被用来避开一些挑战，比如研究表明非刻意练习变量对专家表现有影响的研究。例如，Ericsson 认为一项关于八年级前 5% 读者的大型研究 —— 展示了阅读技能遗传影响的研究（Plomin, Shakeshaft, McMillan, & Trzaskowski, 2014）—— 与专家表现无关，因为所研究的行为不符合专家表现的标准。Ericsson 还指出，双胞胎研究原则上对于专家研究缺乏启示，因为很少有双胞胎展现出真正的专家水平，从而进行行为遗传分析。然而，很明显，按照两个标准差的标准，许多双胞胎确实展现了专家级别的技能。

Fourth, there is the striking observation of secular increases in top levels of expert performance in certain domains (e.g., sports and chess) during the last decades (Lehmann, 1998). This has sometimes been brought forward as evidence that genetic factors are unimportant for expert performance, because it would appear unlikely that significant changes in relevant gene frequencies could have taken place during such a short time period (Ericsson et al., 2007a). However, in general, secular changes in mean level of a trait do not imply that the population variance at a given point in time is nongenetic in nature; well-known examples of highly heritable traits that have shown dramatic increases in Western countries during the last century include body height (Silventoinen et al., 2003) and IQ (Plomin & Spinath, 2004).

第四，最近几十年在某些领域（比如体育和国际象棋）中，顶尖专家表现水平的显著提升引起了广泛关注（Lehmann, 1998）。有时，这种现象被用来论证遗传因素对专家表现的影响不大，因为在如此短的时间内显著改变相关基因频率似乎不太可能（Ericsson 等人，2007a）。然而，通常来说，特质平均水平的世俗变化并不表明在特定时间点的人群变异性完全非遗传；例如，身高（Silventoinen 等人，2003）和智商（Plomin & Spinath，2004）在上个世纪西方国家的显著增长，就是高度遗传性特质的知名例子。

Finally, we would like to consider one of the most common, but also most scientifically problematic, arguments in defense of deliberate practice theory. This is the argument that for deliberate practice theory to be falsified it would have to be demonstrated that variables other than deliberate practice—including traits like intelligence, or genetic factors—limit the ultimate level of expert performance that an individual hypothetically could achieve (Ericsson et al., 2007b). The problem with this proposal is that this could hardly be accomplished, even in principle, because it would require the investigation of an almost infinite number of counterfactual scenarios. Science can investigate existing phenomena in the world as we find it, but it can rarely prove that something never could take place (see, e.g., Plomin et al., 2014). If this suggestion is taken seriously, it would be doubtful whether deliberate practice theory is a falsifiable theory that can be tested empirically. In contrast, a reasonable interpretation of deliberate practice theory does give rise to the testable prediction that most of the variance in expert performance is explained by deliberate practice or, stated differently, that the influence of nondeliberate practice variables on the probability of acquiring expertise is small or insignificant (see the previous section).

最后，我们来探讨一个对刻意练习理论的支持中最常见但也最具科学问题的论点。即要证伪刻意练习理论，需要证明除刻意练习之外的变量 —— 如智力特质或遗传因素 —— 限制了个体理论上能达到的专家表现的最高水平（Ericsson 等人，2007b）。这一提议的挑战在于，实际上这几乎无法实现，因为这需要调查几乎无穷无尽的假设情景。科学能够研究我们所观察到的世界中的现象，但很难证明某些事情绝对不会发生（例如，参见 Plomin 等人，2014）。如果这个建议被严肃考虑，那么刻意练习理论是否是一个可以通过经验方法测试的可证伪理论就变得可疑。相反，对刻意练习理论的一个合理解读提出了一个可测试的预测，即大多数专家表现的变异由刻意练习解释，或者说，非刻意练习变量对于获得专长的可能性影响微小或无关紧要（参见前一部分）。

#### 3.2 A Multifactorial Gene–Environment Interaction Framework for Expertise Studies

Deliberate practice theory posits that only one variable, deliberate practice, is of key importance for expert performance in all domains of expertise. However, the unavoidable conclusion appears to be that this model is too simple: As discussed in detail in the previous sections, deliberate practice theory fails to account for several key findings relating to expertise and expert performance. Accordingly, we believe it is essential for progress in the field that researchers turn to a more progressive, multifactorial framework for expertise studies that allows for a systematic investigation of all factors that influence expert performance and that can give rise to novel, testable hypotheses. An important part of the motivation for a paradigm shift is methodological. If a researcher works on the assumption that deliberate practice is all that matters for expert performance, he or she is likely to choose experimental designs that allow for a characterization of practice effects, but fail to consider the importance of other variables, such as cognitive abilities. In fact, a striking feature of the field as a whole is that relatively few studies have studied expertise in genetically informative samples or investigated the relative importance of deliberate practice and other phenotypic variables for expertise in a systematic manner. The relatively few recent studies that have addressed such issues have indeed provided important evidence for the involvement of variables other than deliberate practice in expertise (see the previous section), and it appears likely that continued research along these lines will be very fruitful for our understanding of expert performance. In this final section, we will summarize the general features of a possible alternative framework for expertise studies, which we dub the multifactorial geneenvironment interaction model (the MGIM). Key features of this framework are schematically illustrated in Figure 1. Variables given in italics under each broader category are specific examples of factors that have been shown empirically to be involved in expertise (see earlier sections).

Figure 1. Schematic summary of main elements of the multifactorial gene–environment interaction model (MGIM). At the phenotypic level (upper part), the MGIM assumes that psychological traits such as abilities, personality, interests, and motivation are associated with the domain and intensity of practice. Specific examples of variables that have been shown to be involved in various forms of expertise are provided in italics under each general heading. Practice will cause adaptations of neural mechanisms involved in expertise and can also influence relevant physical body properties. Furthermore, neural mechanisms related to trait differences may impact expertise independently of practice. Both genetic and nongenetic factors (lower part) influence the various variables that are involved in expertise at the phenotypic level. These influences are likely to be complex and involve both gene–environment interaction effects and covariation between genes and environment (G-E covariation).

Some general similarities between the MGIM and earlier theories of intellectual development should be mentioned. The potential roles of intelligence and interactions between intelligence and practice for the development of expert performance in the MGIM could be seen as generally similar to Cattell’s (1987) model of the development of specialized knowledge in his investment theory. An even closer relationship can been seen with Ackerman’s (1996) PPIK theory, in which adult intellectual development is modeled as a function of intelligence as process, personality, interests, and intelligence as knowledge. The MGIM focuses on the development of expert performance, rather than general intellectual development, but is similarly multifactorial and emphasizes that a wide range of both psychological and physical individual difference variables are likely to be important for expert skills, in a domainspecific way (Figure 1, upper part). A second important feature of the MGIM is that the development of expertise is regarded from a gene–environment interaction perspective, that is, genetic factors, nongenetic factors, and their interactions are considered as important influences on expert performance, deliberate practice, expertise-relevant traits, and their covariation (Figure 1, lower part).

The role of deliberate practice in the MGIM and deliberate practice theory. It may be useful and prevent misunderstandings to begin with the points at which the MGIM and deliberate practice theory agree. One major point of agreement is that deliberate practice is important for expertise. There is ample empirical evidence that deliberate practice is an important predictor of expert performance, and in many domains, it may well turn out to be the most important single predictor, even when other variables are taken into account (Macnamara et al., 2014). The models also agree that one important reason for observed deliberate-practice/ expert-performance correlations is that deliberate practice has causal influences on expert performance. Practice may not make perfect, but it certainly helps. As detailed earlier, prolonged deliberate practice over months and years may lead to extensive anatomical and functional reorganizations of brain circuits that in turn underpin the often astonishing levels of domain-specific performance we see in experts. As discussed earlier, these reorganizations involve brain circuits that enable rapid and efficient interactions between LTM and WM (LTM–WM), as well as sensorimotor skills and optimized processing of domain-specific sensory information; deliberate practice can also modify some physical body properties, such as muscle strength, that are of importance for certain forms of expertise (see Figure 1). Deliberate practice theory and the MGIM agree in that expert performance is the consequence of specialization rather than improvements of general capacity; transfer effects of deliberate practice to nontrained tasks are often negligible.

This stated, the two models also differ in their view of deliberate practice in several important ways. The MGIM emphasizes that deliberate practice cannot be seen as an entirely environmental phenomenon: Engagement in deliberate practice is not a way to “circumvent” genetic limitations. Rather, behavior genetic studies strongly suggest that the quantity, and presumably also quality, of deliberate practice is itself subject to substantial genetic influences. Although deliberate practice certainly has causal influences on expert performance, recent data on musical expert performance show that reverse causality and genetic pleiotropy should be taken as serious empirical possibilities: For both musical discrimination ability (Mosing, Madison, et al., 2014) and accuracy of motor timing (Ullén et al., 2015), it has recently been demonstrated that associations with musical practice are driven essentially by common genetic factors rather than causal effects of practice.

Finally, an important feature of the MGIM is that deliberate practice can be influenced in various ways by variables (abilities, personality, interests, motivation) that potentially impact which domain an individual elects to invest time in, as well as the intensity and quality of the practice itself. Figure 1 provides specific empirically supported examples of such influences (see earlier sections): Both grit and openness have been shown to be associated with the amount of deliberate practice in different domains (Butkovic et al., 2015; Duckworth et al., 2011). For the domain of music, impulsivity has been shown to influence practice quality (Miksza, 2006, 2011). For a general discussion of relations between interests, personality, abilities, and domain of expertise, see, for example, Ackerman (1996), Ackerman et al. (2011), and Kell et al. (2013).

The MGIM at the phenotypic level. An essential difference between deliberate practice theory and the MGIM is that latter assumes, as a central tenet of the model, that expert performance can be influenced directly by a number of other variables than practice. As discussed in the previous section, it appears important to consider a wide range of individual difference variables for expertise, above and beyond effects of practice. These could potentially include different modalities of psychological individual differences—abilities, personality, interests, social attitudes, motivational variables—as well as physical traits (Figure 1, upper part). It appears inevitable that the importance of individual variables will show considerable variation across domains. As summarized earlier, there is clear evidence that, even at high levels of expertise, intelligence and related constructs such as WM are of importance for domains that require the processing of complex and novel information. This includes musical expertise (Meinz & Hambrick, 2010) and chess (Grabner, 2014), and is further corroborated by the general observation that individual differences in spatial and verbal cognitive abilities predict domain-specific performance and achievement, even at the highest levels of intelligence (Kell et al., 2013). Physical traits will matter primarily for forms of expert performance that involve sensorimotor acts: Height and body size are, for example, important for many sports (Ericsson, 2007; Ericsson et al., 1993), whereas biomechanical properties of the hand are importance for instrumental musicians. An important general feature of the MGIM framework is thus that the role of variables other than deliberate practice for expertise may vary between domains.

A second general point is that relations between expert performance and predictor variables are likely to be complex and involve multiplicative as well as additive effects. To give one example, it appears plausible that deliberate practice could interact with intelligence and personality. As discussed previously, deliberate practice would be expected to load strongly on cognitive mechanisms such as attention and metacognition. Not least for cognitively demanding domains, it thus appears possible that the effect of each hour of deliberate practice varies as a function of intelligence—in other words, that there is an interaction between deliberate practice and intelligence. Furthermore, studies on musicians have found relations between personality (impulsivity) and practicing habits (Miksza, 2006, 2011); this suggests the possibility of interactions between deliberate practice and personality.

Such nonlinear relationships are also of interest in relation to the exceptional achievements of prodigies and eminent creators, compared with individuals with comparable levels of deliberate practice. These provide yet another anomaly for deliberate practice theory, whereas it would seem that they can be readily explained within the MGIM if performance is assumed to depend on both additive effects and multiplicative interactions between deliberate practice and other variables (Lykken, 2005; Mosing & Ullén, in press; Simonton, 1984).

The MGIM: Genetic perspectives. A major reason for the shortcomings of deliberate practice theory is its extreme environmentalist perspective. In contrast, the MGIM assumes—on the basis of both available data and theoretical considerations—that genetic factors are likely to be important for expertise in a number of ways (see Figure 1, lower part). First, one should consider practice-independent genetic effects on traits that are relevant for expert performance. One obvious variable of interest in this context is intelligence, which is highly heritable (Jensen, 1998; Plomin & Spinath, 2004), and likely to be important for many forms of expert performance, even at high levels of deliberate practice (see previous sections). Many genetic effects on anthropometric properties are also likely to fall in this category. Training-independent genetic effects should also be considered in relation to more narrow abilities of relevance for expert performance. One alreadymentioned example is musical discrimination, which shows a genetic overlap with intelligence as well as more specific genetic influences (Mosing, Pedersen, et al., 2014).

Other genetic factors will affect expert performance through their effects on deliberate practice and its covariates. This suggests that the genetic architecture of expert performance may be different at different levels of deliberate practice. Indeed, preliminary findings support that the heritability of expert performance may actually increase rather than decrease with deliberate practice, contrary to predictions of deliberate practice theory (Hambrick & Tucker-Drob, 2015). More generally, this also highlights the potential importance of more complex interplay between genes and environment—that is, gene–environment interactions (Kennedy et al., 2011; Schellenberg, 2015) and various forms of geneenvironment covariation (Scarr, 1996), for expertise.



### 04. Conclusion

The last decade has witnessed an impressive development in expertise research through the combination of experimental psychology with more novel methods, in particular, human neuroimaging techniques. An important reason for this is that cognitive modeling of expert performance now can be integrated with neurobiological studies of its underlying mechanisms. We believe there is every reason to expect continued development of the field, if expertise research is performed in a multivariate framework that also includes methods from differential psychology and behavior genetics. This will presumably lead to more complex, but also more interesting and fruitful, models of expertise than currently exist, in which the development of domain-specific competence is seen to depend on genes, environment, practice, and traits in complex interactions.

过去十年，结合了实验心理学和一些新兴方法，尤其是人类神经成像技术，我们已经见证了在专家知识研究领域的显著进展。一个关键原因是，专家表现的认知模型现在能够和其基础神经生物学机制的研究相结合。我们有理由相信，如果专家知识研究采用一个多元化的框架进行，这个框架同时涵盖差异心理学和行为遗传学的方法，这个领域的发展将会持续。这样做很可能会带来比现有的更为复杂、更加引人入胜且成果更丰富的专家知识模型。在这些模型中，特定领域的能力发展被认为是基因、环境、练习和个性特质在复杂相互作用下的结果。
