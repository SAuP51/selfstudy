Conclusion Transcript

Congratulations on making it to the end of this short course. 

In summary, in this short course you've learned about two key principles for prompting. Write clear and specific instructions, and when it's appropriate, give the model time to think. You also learned about iterative prompt development and how having a process to get to the prompt that's right for your application is key. 

And we went through a few capabilities of large language models that are useful for many applications, specifically summarizing, inferring, transforming, and expanding. 

And you also saw how to build a custom chatbot. That was a lot that you learned in just one short course, and I hope you enjoyed going through these materials. 

We hope you'll come up with some ideas for applications that you can build yourself now. Please go try this out and let us know what you come up with. No application is too small, it's fine to start with something that's kind of a very small project with maybe a little bit of utility or maybe it's not even useful at all, it's just something fun. 

Yeah, and I find playing with these models actually really fun, so go play with it! 

I agree, it's a good weekend activity, speaking from experience. 

Uhm, and just, you know, please use the learnings from your first project to build a better second project and you know, maybe even a better third project, so on. That's kind of how I have kind of grown over time using these models myself as well. 

Or if you have an idea for a bigger project already, just go for it. And you know, as a reminder, these kind of large language models are a very powerful technology, so it kind of goes without saying that we ask you to use them responsibly and please only build things that will have a positive impact. 

Yeah, I fully agree. I think in this age, people that build AI systems can have a huge impact on others. So it's more important than ever that all of us only use these tools responsibly. 

Uhm, and I think building large language model based applications is just a very exciting and growing field right now. And now that you've finished this course, I think you now have a wealth of knowledge that let you build things that few people today know how to. So, I hope you also help us to spread the word and encourage others to take this course too. In closing, I hope you had fun doing this course, and I want to thank you for finishing this course. And both Ezra and I look forward to hearing about the amazing things that you build.

恭喜你完成了这个短期课程。

总之，在这个短期课程中，你学到了关于提示的两个关键原则。写清楚和具体的指示，当适当的时候，给模型时间去思考。你还了解了迭代式提示开发以及如何获得适合你应用程序的提示的过程是关键的。

我们还介绍了大语言模型的一些功能，这些功能对许多应用程序都很有用，特别是总结、推断、转换和扩展。

你还看到了如何构建一个自定义的聊天机器人。在这个短期课程中你学到了很多，我希望你喜欢这些资料。

我们希望你能提出一些你现在可以自己构建的应用程序的想法。请试一试，让我们知道你的成果。没有应用程序太小，开始一个非常小的项目也没问题，也许有一点点实用性，或者甚至一点也不实用，只是有趣。

是的，我觉得玩这些模型真的很有趣，所以去玩吧！

我同意，这是一个很好的周末活动，我有这样的经验。

嗯，你知道，请从你的第一个项目中学到的东西来构建一个更好的第二个项目，也许甚至是一个更好的第三个项目，等等。这就是我使用这些模型的时间如何增长的。

或者，如果你已经有了一个更大的项目的想法，那就去做吧。你知道，作为一个提醒，这种大型的语言模型是一种非常强大的技术，所以不用说我们请你负责任地使用它们，并且请只构建那些会产生积极影响的东西。

是的，我完全同意。我认为在这个时代，建造 AI 系统的人可以对其他人产生巨大的影响。所以比以往任何时候都更重要的是，我们都只能负责任地使用这些工具。

嗯，我认为构建基于大型语言模型的应用程序现在是一个非常令人兴奋和增长的领域。现在你完成了这门课程，我认为你现在有了大量的知识，让你建造很少人知道如何做的东西。所以，我希望你也帮助我们传播这个消息，鼓励其他人也来上这门课程。最后，我希望你在这门课程中玩得开心，我要感谢你完成这门课程。Ezra 和我都期待听到你所建造的惊人的东西。
