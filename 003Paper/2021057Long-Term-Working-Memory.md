### Abstract

To account for the large demands on working memory during text comprehension and expert performance, the traditional models of working memory involving temporary storage must be extended to include working memory based on storage in long-term memory. In the proposed theoretical framework cognitive processes are viewed as a sequence of stable states representing end products of processing. In skilled activities, acquired memory skills allow these end products to be stored in long- term memory and kept directly accessible by means of retrieval cues in short-term memory, as proposed by skilled memory theory. These theoretical claims are supported by a review of evidence on memory in text comprehension and expert performance in such domains as mental calculation, medical diagnosis, and chess.

为了应对文本理解和高水平技能表现过程中对工作记忆的巨大需求，我们需要对传统的临时存储的工作记忆模型进行扩展，引入一种基于长期记忆存储的工作记忆概念。在这个新的理论框架下，我们将认知过程看作是一系列稳定状态的连续，这些状态代表了处理过程的最终产物。在像玩国际象棋、心算或进行医学诊断这样的技能活动中，人们通过学习获得的记忆技巧，能够将这些处理结果保存在长期记忆中，并通过短期记忆中的提示线索快速检索。这套理论不仅是空中楼阁，它已通过在文本理解和各种专业技能表现（比如心算、医学诊断和国际象棋等）的记忆研究中得到了实证支持。

To perform complex cognitive tasks, people must maintain access to large amounts of information. For example, an individual reading a sentence in a text must have access to previously mentioned actors and objects to resolve references to pronouns. The individual also needs contextual information to integrate coherently information presented in the current sentence with the text previously read. Similarly, mental calculators must maintain the results of intermediate steps in memory, as, for example, when they mentally multiply two 5-digit numbers. Chess masters can play chess games without being able to see and manipulate a chess board, thus they are able to keep the current locations of all the chess pieces in accessible form in memory. These working contexts, with their accessible information that change as the individuals continue with the task, are often informally referred to as instances of working memory. The standard definition of working memory is more restrictive, however, and refers "to the temporary storage of information that is being processed in any of a range of cognitive tasks" (Baddeley, 1986, p. 34, italics added), that is, to information maintained in readily accessible storage for only a short period of time without rehearsal or re-activation. If the standard definition with its mechanism is accepted as an account of all instances of working memory several critical issues emerge. In subsequent sections we will focus, in particular, on the following: Can mechanisms that account for subjects'limited working-memory capacity in laboratory tasks also account for the greatly expanded working-memory capacity of experts and skilled performers? How can working memory based on temporary storage account for the fact that skilled activities can be interrupted and later resumed without major effects on performance?

In this paper we propose that a general account of working memory has to include in addition to the temporary storage of information that we refer to as short-term working memory (ST-WM), another mechanism based on skilled use of storage in long-term memory (LTM) that we refer to as long-term working memory (LT-WM). Information in LT-WM is stored in stable form, but reliable access to it may be maintained only temporarily by means of retrieval cues in ST-WM. Hence LT-WM is distinguished from ST-WM by the durability of the storage it provides and the need for sufficient retrieval cues in attention for access to information.

为了应对复杂的思维挑战，我们需要随时调用大量的信息。比如，当我们读到一个新句子，为了理解其中的代词指向谁，就得回忆起文中之前出现过的人和事。同时，我们还需要利用上下文，把新的信息融入到已有的知识体系中。举个例子，擅长心算的人在脑海中计算两个五位数相乘时，必须记住每一步的中间结果；象棋高手即便不看棋盘，也能准确记住棋子的位置。这种在心中进行的信息处理，通常我们称之为「工作记忆」。但严格来说，「工作记忆」指的是一种临时存储机制，用于处理各种认知任务中的信息（Baddeley, 1986），即这些信息在短时间内可被随时调用，无需通过重复或再激活来保持。这种定义带来了几个问题：如何解释在实验室之外，专家或熟练人士显示出来的工作记忆能力显著提升？临时存储如何支持中断后能无损地恢复熟练活动？

本文认为，要全面理解工作记忆，除了短期存储机制（即短期工作记忆，ST-WM）外，还需要考虑长期记忆（LTM）中基于技能的存储机制，我们称之为长期工作记忆（LT-WM）。在 LT-WM 中，信息被稳定保存，而通过在 ST-WM 中设置检索线索，这些信息可以被暂时但可靠地访问。因此，LT-WM 与 ST-WM 的区别在于它所提供的存储更为持久，并且访问这些信息需要足够的检索线索。

The classic distinction between STM and LTM Atkinson Shiffrin, 1968; Waugh D. A. Norman, 1965) has remained a central feature of all major information-processing theories of memory (see Cowan, 1988, and Estes, 1988, for recent reviews). The new contribution we hope to explicate is that reliance on acquired memory skills will enable individuals to use LTM as an efficient extension of ST-WM in particular domains and activities after sufficient practice and training. Extending the Chase-Ericsson (1982) Skilled Memory Theory, we show that mechanisms similar to those underlying a ten-fold increase in performance on tests of STM are used by experts and skilled performers to extend their effective working-memory capacity. In particular, our extension will focus on mechanisms that allow skilled performers to overcome proactive interference caused by prior storage of similar information in LTM. According to our concept of LT-WM with reliable access, individuals rely on specific control processes to encode heeded information in retrievable form. Specifically, individuals draw on acquired knowledge and on systems of retrieval cues that we refer to as retrieval structures. Within our proposal for LT-WM we can easily account for skilled performers'expanded capacity of working memory in activities for which they have acquired knowledge and special memory skills. Furthermore, storage of information in LT-WM implies that most types of accessible information in working memory will remain in LTM during an interruption of skilled activities and can be easily reinstated by reactivation of necessary retrieval cues.

Our proposal that efficient storage and retrieval characteristics can be acquired for LTM by skilled performers might seem to blur the traditional functional distinctions between STM and LTM. Consequently, we will start the paper with a review of research on human memory to show that for skilled performance there is extensive evidence for flexibility of characteristics of LTM and the development of skills leads to (1) increased speed of storage and retrieval on specific memory tasks through practice, (2) incidental storage of information in LTM during skilled activities and (3) memory skills for selective storage in and retrieval from LTM. We will then contrast our proposal to other theories of working memory. Unlike most other general theories of working memory, our concept of LT-WM is a memory skill that individuals acquire to meet the particular memory demands of a complex, cognitive activity in a particular domain. In separate sections on text comprehension and expert performance we will describe the mechanisms of LT-WM in detail.

在记忆研究领域，短期记忆（STM）和长期记忆（LTM）之间的经典区分（如 Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968; Waugh & D. A. Norman, 1965 所述）一直是所有主要信息处理理论的核心。我们希望介绍的新观点是，通过足够的练习和训练，依靠习得的记忆技巧，个体能够将长期记忆作为特定领域和活动中短期工作记忆的高效扩展。我们以 Chase-Ericsson（1982）的熟练记忆理论为基础，展示了专家和熟练表演者是如何利用类似于显著提高短期记忆测试表现的机制，从而扩展他们有效的工作记忆容量的。特别是，我们关注的是允许熟练表演者克服长期记忆中类似信息存储引起的前向干扰的机制。

根据我们关于具有可靠访问性的长期工作记忆的理念，个体依赖于特定的控制过程，将所注意的信息编码成可检索的形式。具体来说，个体依赖于他们所习得的知识和所称的检索结构中的检索线索系统。在我们对长期工作记忆的提议中，我们能够轻松地解释熟练表演者在其习得知识和特殊记忆技巧的活动中工作记忆容量的扩展。此外，信息存储在长期工作记忆中意味着，在熟练活动被中断时，大部分工作记忆中的可访问信息将继续保留在长期记忆中，并且可以通过激活必要的检索线索来轻松恢复。

我们认为，熟练表演者可以为长期记忆习得高效的存储和检索特性的提议，可能会让人觉得短期记忆和长期记忆之间传统的功能区分变得模糊。因此，我们将以回顾人类记忆研究的方式开篇，展示对于熟练表现而言，有充分的证据表明长期记忆特性的灵活性，以及技能发展导致了通过练习提高特定记忆任务的存储和检索速度、在熟练活动中偶然地存储信息至长期记忆、以及选择性地从长期记忆中存储和检索信息的记忆技能。接下来，我们将把我们的提议与其他工作记忆理论进行对比。不同于大多数其他工作记忆的普遍理论，我们的长期工作记忆理念是个体为满足特定领域复杂认知活动的特定记忆需求而习得的记忆技能。在关于文本理解和专家表现的独立章节中，我们将详细介绍长期工作记忆的机制。

### 01. A Brief Review of Research on Memory

Until quite recently researchers did not study directly the availability and accessibility of information stored in working memory during complex cognitive processes. Instead, they made inferences about working memory from studies of general memory capacity. Ever since Ebbinghaus (1885/1913)researchers have concentrated on deriving general laws and capacities for memory from simple tasks explicitly designed to study memory performance for arbitrary sequences of information. The standard procedure has been to present a list of unrelated items and to require reproduction with either immediate free recall or free recall after some interpolated activity. In the traditional model of human memory (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968; Waugh & D. A. Norman, 1968), immediate free recall yields items directly retrieved from a temporary short-term memory (STM) and items retrieved by retrieval cues from a more durable storage in long-term memory (LTM). STM is assumed to have a limited capacity of around seven chunks (G. A. Miller, 1956), a chunk corresponding to a familiar pattern already stored in LTM. Storage in STM is temporary, and when attention is diverted to another demanding task, information originally stored in STM becomes unavailable in a matter of seconds (Brown, 1958; L. R. Peterson & M. J. Peterson, 1959). In contrast, the storage capacity of LTM is assumed to be vast and much more durable than that of STM. Storage in LTM is assumed to be primarily associative, relating different items to one another and relating items to attributes of the current situation (current context). The time required for storage of a new retrievable memory trace in LTM has been estimated to be relatively long--about ten seconds (Simon, 1973). The primary bottleneck for retrieval from LTM is the scarcity of retrieval cues that are related by association to the desired item, stored in LTM.

直到不久前，研究者们并未直接探讨在复杂思维过程中，工作记忆中存储的信息的可用性和易获取性。相反，他们通过研究记忆的整体容量来间接了解工作记忆的情况。自 Ebbinghaus（1885/1913）起，研究者便专注于从设计来明确研究记忆表现的简单任务中，提取记忆的普遍规律和能力，这些任务通常涉及记忆一系列任意信息。常规的做法是展示一个由不相关项目组成的列表，并要求参与者在进行了某些其他活动后立刻自由回忆或稍后自由回忆这些项目。在人类记忆的传统模型（Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968; Waugh & D. A. Norman, 1968）中，立即的自由回忆能够直接从短期记忆（STM）中检索到项目，以及通过从长期记忆（LTM）中更持久的存储里通过线索检索到的项目。STM 被认为容量有限，大约能容纳七个信息块（G. A. Miller, 1956），每个信息块对应于 LTM 中已有的熟悉模式。STM 中的信息存储是暂时的，一旦注意力被分散到另一个任务上，原先存储在 STM 中的信息就会在几秒内变得无法获取（Brown, 1958; L. R. Peterson & M. J. Peterson, 1959）。与此相对，LTM 的存储容量则被认为是巨大且远比 STM 持久的。LTM 的存储被认为主要是基于关联，即将不同项目彼此关联，以及将项目与当前情境的属性联系起来。在 LTM 中形成一个新的、可检索的记忆痕迹所需的时间相对较长 —— 大约需要十秒（Simon, 1973）。从 LTM 中检索信息的主要瓶颈是与所需项目相关联的线索的稀缺，这些线索被存储在 LTM 中。

During free recall subjects are asked to retrieve a list they studied earlier. At the time of recall the subjects have no direct retrieval cues for the list in STM, and many theorists(Walter Schneider Detweiler, 1987; Shiffrin, 1976)have proposed that recall must be mediated by the cues available in the current context. If some of the cues in the context for recall were still available in the context for study of the list, they should be part of the memory trace and thus serve as retrieval cues for items in the list to be recalled. Once some items have been recalled, they can serve as additional retrieval cues. Consistent with this proposed mechanism, free recall in most list-learning experiments is relatively poor and decreases as a function of the number of lists the subjects have previously studied and thus linked to the same contextual cues.

In most of the prodigious research on memory, investigators have tried to isolate different memory systems and to specify their storage and retrieval characteristics with general measures that are independent of materials and of subjects'specific background knowledge. Researchers have focused on estimating maximal capacities by studying memory performance in simple tasks that test only memory. It is generally assumed that the same distinctions and capacity limitations observed for simple tasks apply to working memory in complex cognitive activities.

在自由回忆任务中，参与者被要求回想之前学习过的一系列信息。在这个过程中，参与者在短期记忆中并没有直接的提示帮助他们回忆信息，许多理论家（例如 Walter Schneider & Detweiler, 1987; Shiffrin, 1976）认为，回忆依赖于当前环境中的可用线索。如果一些回忆时的环境线索在学习时也存在，那么这些线索应该成为记忆痕迹的一部分，并作为回忆信息的线索。一旦回忆起某些信息，它们也可以成为新的线索。这个机制解释了为什么在大多数学习列表的实验中，自由回忆的效果通常不佳，并且随着参与者之前学过的列表数量增加，回忆效果会下降，因为这些列表都与相同的环境线索相关联。

在众多关于记忆的研究中，研究者试图区分不同的记忆系统，并尝试明确它们各自的存储和检索特点，这些特点不受测试材料和参与者个人背景知识的影响。研究人员尝试通过只测试记忆的简单任务来估计记忆的最大容量。普遍认为，这些简单任务中观察到的区分和容量限制同样适用于在复杂认知活动中的工作记忆。

### 02. From General Theories of Memory to Models of Working Memory

General theories of memory, which are based on performance on memory tasks, incorporate constraints on storage and retrieval that are assumed to apply to any type of activity. When investigators began studying more complex cognitive processes, such as problem solving, decision making, and concept formation, the models they developed had to be consistent with these theories. An adequate model of performance in a task had to specify the relevant background knowledge and skills subjects had as well as sequences of processes that did not violate the constraints on the amount of information kept available in memory (that is, working memory).

"Availability of information" generally implies both rapid and reliable, essentially error-free, storage of and access to that information. In traditional memory experiments these criteria for availability are met only for information stored in STM. Because our proposal for working memory is based on storage in LTM, we briefly review some of the major reasons that LTM has been considered insufficient to support reliable storage of available information.

In standard theories of memory (Atkinson Shiffrin, 1968) information can be stored in LTM only after it has been stored in STM, and even then, storage in LTM is a probabilistic event. Originally, Atkinson and Shiffrin proposed that the probability of storage in LTM is a function of the time an item was maintained in STM. More recently, Anderson(1983) suggested that the probability of storage is a function of the number of times an item enters STM. Subjects' control of the storage of information appears to be limited, as shown, for example, by low levels of free recall in list learning. Furthermore. in more meaningful tasks subiects' recall of presented information is not improved when they are instructed to study that information for later recall (Craik Lockhart, 1972). This finding implies that subiects cannot achieve reliable storage of information in many of the standard memory tasks. Anderson (1983) goes even so far as to argue that subiects' inability to control storage in LTM is beneficial since they cannot predict what information will be useful later on. The memory performance exhibited by subiects in standard memory tasks is clearly consistent with the view that storage of information in LTM and efficient access of that information is too unreliable to be an effective source of working memorv. We argue later in this paper. however. that the performance of untrained subiects who memorize lists of unrelated items in the laboratory does not accurately describe the efficient storage and retrieval that experts in specific domains can achieve after many years of practice.

一般的记忆理论基于记忆任务的表现，引入了被认为适用于所有类型活动的存储和检索限制。当研究人员开始探究更为复杂的认知过程，例如解决问题、决策和概念建立时，他们发展的模型必须与这些理论相符。一个合格的任务表现模型需要明确参与者所具有的相关背景知识和技能，以及不违反工作记忆中可保持信息量限制的处理流程。

所谓的「信息可用性」，通常指的是信息存储和访问的快速、可靠性，基本上是无误的。在传统记忆实验中，这种可用性标准仅适用于短时记忆 (STM) 中存储的信息。鉴于我们对工作记忆的理解是建立在长时记忆 (LTM) 存储基础上的，我们简要回顾了一些人们认为长时记忆不足以支撑信息可靠存储的主要原因。

根据标准的记忆理论（Atkinson 和 Shiffrin，1968 年），信息只有在存储于短时记忆后才能被转移到长时记忆中，即使如此，转存到长时记忆中也是一个概率事件。最初，Atkinson 和 Shiffrin 提出，一个信息项转存到长时记忆的概率依赖于它在短时记忆中维持的时间。而 Anderson（1983 年）后来提出，这一概率与信息项进入短时记忆的次数有关。实验证明，参与者对信息存储的控制是有限的，例如，在列表学习任务中的自由回忆表现较差。而且，在更有意义的任务中，即使参与者被告知学习信息以便后续回忆，他们对信息的回忆并未因此而提高（Craik 和 Lockhart，1972 年）。这表明，在许多标准记忆任务中，参与者无法实现信息的可靠存储。Anderson（1983 年）进一步指出，参与者无法控制信息在长时记忆中的存储其实是有益的，因为他们无法预测哪些信息将来会有用。在标准记忆任务中，参与者表现出的记忆能力清楚地表明，信息在长时记忆中的存储和高效访问太不可靠，不能有效地支撑工作记忆。然而，我们在文中后续部分争论，未经训练的参与者在实验室里记忆无关联项目列表的表现，并不能准确反映特定领域内专家经过多年实践后能够实现的高效存储和检索能力。

Models of working memory have focused on the availability of information in STM which has limited capacity. No model of working memory can reasonably allow greater working capacity during performance of a specific task than the maximal capacity of working memory measured in a pure memory task. That is, the capacity of working memory must be much less than the memory span of seven chunks (G. A. Miller, 1956), in which perfect recall is achieved only 50% of time on the average. Hence the capacity of reliable working memory is assumed to be only around four chunks (Broadbent, 1975). Such a severe limit on working memory might seem far too restrictive to allow for human performance levels. Laboratory studies have shown, however, that a wide range of cognitive activities, such as problem solving (Atwood, Masson, & Polson, 1980; Newell & Simon, 1972), concept formation (Levine, 1966), and decision making (Payne, 1976), can be successfully accounted for by models that permit storage of a very small number of products in STM.

Newell and Simon (1972) proposed a production-system architecture for cognitive processes that has influenced most subsequent efforts to build models and theories. In this architecture the conditions of a large number of productions (condition-action pairs) are matched against the currently active elements (working memory). In more recent models, such as Anderson's (1983) ACT*, working memory is the transiently activated portion of LTM. The limits on the number of elements in working memory are not determined by a fixed number but rather by the amount of available activation. In his work on building ACT* models of cognitive processing Anderson found that working memory can sometimes contain over 20 units at one time. To reconcile such a large capacity of working memory with the much smaller capacity of STM. Anderson (1983) argued as follows: The activation of elements decays very rapidly. For this reason the number of units that can be actively maintained long enough to be included in immediate recall is much less than all of the information activated at the start of recall. Most investigators argue, however, that the capacity of working memory must be far greater than the capacity of traditional STM (Newell. 1990).

工作记忆模型主要关注短时记忆（STM）中信息的可用性，而短时记忆的容量是有限的。没有一个工作记忆模型能够合理地允许特定任务执行期间的工作容量超过在纯记忆任务中测量到的工作记忆的最大容量。也就是说，工作记忆的容量必须远小于七个信息块（G. A. Miller, 1956 所定义的记忆跨度），在这个标准下，平均情况下只有 50% 的时间能实现完美回忆。因此，可靠的工作记忆容量被认为仅约为四个信息块（Broadbent, 1975）。这样对工作记忆的严格限制似乎会极大地限制人类的表现水平。然而，实验室研究显示，如问题解决（Atwood 等人，1980 年；Newell 与 Simon，1972 年），概念形成（Levine，1966 年），和决策（Payne，1976 年）等一系列认知活动，都可以通过模型成功地解释，这些模型允许在短时记忆中存储极少量的信息产品。

Newell 和 Simon（1972 年）提出了一种生产系统架构，用于认知过程，这个架构影响了后续大多数模型和理论的构建。在这个架构中，大量的生产条件（条件 - 动作对）与当前活跃的元素（工作记忆）相匹配。在较新的模型中，比如 Anderson（1983 年）的 ACT 模型，工作记忆被视为长时记忆（LTM）暂时激活的部分。工作记忆中的元素数量限制不是由一个固定数目决定，而是由可用的激活量来决定。Anderson 在构建 ACT 认知处理模型的研究中发现，工作记忆有时候可以同时容纳超过 20 个单元。为了调和工作记忆的大容量与短时记忆相对较小的容量之间的矛盾，Anderson（1983 年）这样论证：元素的激活非常快速地衰减。因此，能够长时间保持活跃并包含在即时回忆中的单位数量，远少于回忆开始时激活的所有信息。然而，大多数研究者认为，工作记忆的容量必须远大于传统短时记忆的容量（Newell, 1990）。

Working memory in production-system architectures was originally viewed as a single construct with general resources. In a very influential line of empirical research initiated by Baddeley and Hitch (1974), investigators examined this assertion by studying the effect on cognitive performance from an additional concurrent task specifically designed to interfere with the capacity of working memory. The result of over a decade's active research on that and related paradigms (reviewed by Baddeley, 1986) conflicted with the single-construct view. Although reliable decrements in speed and/or accuracy of cognitive processes were often obtained for the main task when an additional memory task was introduced, the primary task performance decreased for the most part only slightly even when subjects had to maintain 3 to 6 digits (near their digit span) in working memory while executing the primary task. To account for these findings Baddeley (1986) proposed that in addition to a central executive there are two slave systems. the articulatory loop and the visuo-spatial scratch pad. in which the central executive can store information temporarily. Investigators have obtained converging evidence for these subsystems by examining the relation between individual differences on the main task and on tasks measuring various types of memory performance. Of particular interest are findings from neuro-psychological patients who exhibit exceptionally poor performance on tasks that measure the capacity of one of the subsystems, for example, memory span for words which is assumed to measure the capacity of the articulatory loop. Consistent with the independence of the subsystems in Baddeley's model, patients with dramatically impaired subsystems are still able to perform text comprehension tasks at normal levels (Baddeley, Papagno Valla, 1988: Baddeley & Wilson, 1988; Martin, 1993). At the same time this finding means that working memory in such skilled activities as text comprehension must be accounted for by the central executive and thus remains essentially unexplained.

In sum, recent research has shown that working memory does not consist of a single general capacity, but rather consists of several subsystems that can be relied on to complete various types of tasks (Baddeley, 1986). Interference with either of these subsystems by a concurrent secondary task degrades performance on the primary task only slightly. This finding implies that the central executive has sufficient working memory capacity to complete the processing. Of particular interest to the LT- WM we propose is the observation that concurrent memory tasks appear to cause the least impairment in highly skilled activities such as piano playing (Allport, Antonis & Reynolds, 1972), typing (Shaffer, 1975), and reading (see Baddeley, 1986, for a review). As explained in the following section, general theories of memory provide a better account of working memory when subiects are performing unfamiliar tasks than they do when subiects are performing skilled activities. for which demands on working memory are considerably larger. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that working memory in a specific, skilled activity increases as one aspect of acquired skill.

在生产系统架构下的工作记忆最初被看作是一个带有通用资源的单一结构。Baddeley 和 Hitch 在 1974 年开启的一系列具有深远影响的实证研究中，研究人员通过研究一项特别设计出来干扰工作记忆容量的附加任务对认知性能的影响来审视这一假设。经过超过十年的积极研究（由 Baddeley 于 1986 年回顾），得出的结论与单一结构的观点相悖。虽然当引入一个额外的记忆任务时，主任务的认知过程的速度和 / 或准确度常常会有可靠的下降，但在大多数情况下，即使受试者需要在工作记忆中维持 3 到 6 个数字（接近他们的数字记忆跨度）时执行主任务，主任务的表现只会轻微下降。为了解释这些发现，Baddeley 在 1986 年提出，除了中央执行器外，还存在两个辅助系统：语言回路和视觉空间记事本，中央执行器可以在其中暂时存储信息。通过考察个体在主要任务和测量各种记忆表现的任务上的差异，研究人员为这些子系统找到了相互支持的证据。特别引人注意的是，那些在测量某个子系统容量的任务上表现异常差的神经心理学患者的研究结果，例如，用于测量语言回路容量的单词记忆跨度。与 Baddeley 模型中子系统的独立性相一致的是，即使子系统功能严重受损的患者，仍能正常完成文本理解任务（Baddeley, Papagno Valla, 1988; Baddeley & Wilson, 1988; Martin, 1993）。同时，这一发现意味着在文本理解等熟练活动中的工作记忆必须通过中央执行器来进行解释，因此其本质上还未被完全阐释。

总的来说，最近的研究显示，工作记忆不是由单一的通用容量组成，而是由几个可以依赖完成各种类型任务的子系统组成（Baddeley, 1986）。一个并行的次要任务干扰这些子系统中的任何一个，只会轻微降低主任务的表现。这一发现表明中央执行器有足够的工作记忆容量来完成处理。特别值得关注的是，我们所提出的长期工作记忆（LT-WM）中，并行记忆任务似乎对高度熟练的活动如弹钢琴（Allport, Antonis & Reynolds, 1972），打字（Shaffer, 1975），和阅读（见 Baddeley, 1986 的综述）造成的影响最小。如下一节所解释的，当受试者执行不熟悉的任务而非熟练活动时，通用记忆理论对工作记忆的解释更为充分，因为对于后者，对工作记忆的需求明显更大。这一发现与我们的假设相吻合，即在特定的、熟练的活动中，随着技能的获得，工作记忆的容量也会增加。

#### 2.1 Differences Between Memory in Standard Memory Tasks and in Complex Cognitive performance

The cognitive skills individuals apply to complex tasks are fundamentally different from those they apply to standard memory tasks with arbitrary materials. We note three significant differences and demonstrate how. within a specific domain. individuals can acquire memory skills and thereby increase the available working memory capacity beyond the domain-general capacity proposed by traditional theories of memory. First, individuals attain a particular level of performance in complex cognitive tasks only over extended periods of time, and much of the information is familiar and meaningful to their activity. In contrast, traditional studies of memory minimize relevant experience by using naive subiects and lists of unrelated items. As part of the acquisition of skill. individuals acquire the ability to rapidly store in LTM relevant information which they are presented. Contrary to earlier views, it is possible for individuals to reliably store selected information in LTM even when presentation rates are relatively fast. Secondly, unlike the directed and effortful task of memorizing as much as possible from a list. storage of relevant information in lTm during skilled performance is a natural consequence of performing. The ability to select relevant information and anticipate future retrieval demands is an integral aspect of acquired skill and reduces dramatically the amount of information that must be stored. Finally, skilled performance requires that all relevant information be rapidly and reliably accessible. Traditional memory paradigms involving recognition tests and free recall were developed to assess whether some input was stored in memory rather than whether some particular task-relevant information could be accessed reliably within a few seconds. Rapid recall of some information was interpreted as evidence that information had been stored in STM. A different methodology for measuring the speed and accuracy of selective recall is required for assessing the accessibility of information in working memory.

个体处理复杂任务时运用的认知技能与他们应对带有随机材料的标准记忆任务时使用的技能存在本质上的差异。我们发现了三个显著的区别，并展示了个体如何在特定领域通过学习记忆技能，进而将他们的工作记忆容量扩展到超越传统记忆理论所认为的通用容量。

首先，个体仅通过长期的学习和实践，才能在复杂的认知任务中达到一定的水平，他们活动中涉及的信息通常是他们熟悉且富有意义的。相反，传统的记忆研究往往通过使用没有相关经验的受试者和一系列无关联的项目来减少相关经验的影响。作为技能学习的一部分，个体学会了迅速地将他们接触到的相关信息存入长时记忆中。不同于早期的观点，即便是在快速的信息呈现速度下，个体也能可靠地将选定的信息存储到长时记忆中。

其次，不像记忆列表中尽可能多信息的有意识和需要努力的任务，熟练表现期间相关信息的存储是自然发生的，这种能力的获得，减少了必须存储的信息量，是技能获取的一个核心方面。最后，熟练的表现要求所有相关信息能够被快速且可靠地获取。传统的记忆模式，比如识别测试和自由回忆，主要用于判断某个输入是否被记忆，而不是判断特定的、与任务相关的信息是否能在几秒内可靠获取。对于某些信息的快速回忆被看作是这些信息已经被存储在短时记忆中的证据。而评估工作记忆中信息的可获取性，需要采用不同的方法来测量选择性回忆的速度和准确性。

#### 2.2 Increased Memory Performance due to Acauired Knowledge and Skill

It is generally observed that memory performance increases after an individual practices on memory tasks involving specific types of materials and that an individual's familiarity with a given type of material is related to the amount of material recalled (see Ericsson, 1985, for a review). Increases in memory performance are not in themselves inconsistent with the notion that the capacity of the human memory system is invariant. and they have traditionally been accounted for in terms of chunking (G. A. Miller, 1956). With more familiarity and experience with a particular type of stimulus material. subiects acquire over time a set of complex patterns in ltm that allows them to represent subsequently presented information in terms of already acquired patterns (chunks)of elements rather than individual stimulus elements. The most direct predictions of the chunking model can be made for rapidly presented information. where storage in LTM is minimized or even be completely eliminated. Under those conditions, recall of presented information is assumed to be restricted to the activated chunks in STM. Consistent with these predictions subiects can recall about the same number of random letters (consonants) as unrelated words, where each word corresponds to a chunk of letters (G. A. Miller. 1956).

Large differences between experts' memory performance and that of novices have similarly been accounted for in terms of chunking. In their pioneering research on the superior memory of chess experts, Chase and Simon (1973) proposed that after many years of study chess experts have stored a large number of specific patterns of chess pieces (chunks) in LTM. This memory representation allows them to rapidly recognize several patterns in a presented chess position and thus to encode and recall many chess pieces by relying only on the fixed number of chunks in STM. Consistent with the hypothesis that the chess experts'superior memory was mediated by familiar meaningful configurations of chess pieces, Chase and Simon found that the experts'advantage disappeared when chess boards of randomly arranged chess pieces were used as stimuli in the memory tasks. Experts'superior memory for representative stimuli from their domain of expertise, but not for randomly rearranged versions of those stimuli, has been frequently replicated in chess (see Charness, 1991, for a review) and also demonstrated in bridge (Charness, 1979; Engle & Bukstel, 1978); go (Reitman, 1976); music (Sloboda, 1976); electronics (Egan Schwartz, 1979); computer programming (McKeithen, Reitman, Rueter, Hirtle, 1981); dance, basketball, and field hockey (Allard Starkes, 1991); and figure skating (Deakin Allard, 1991).

人们普遍观察到，个体在经过特定类型材料的记忆任务训练后，其记忆表现会提升，且个体对某种类型材料的熟悉程度与其能回忆出的材料量直接相关（参考 Ericsson, 1985 年的综述）。记忆表现的提升并不与人类记忆系统容量恒定的观点相矛盾，这些提升传统上被归因于「分块」机制（G. A. Miller, 1956）。随着对某一类刺激材料的熟悉度和经验的增加，受试者逐渐在长时记忆中形成了一套复杂的模式，使他们能够以已获得的模式（即「块」）来代表后续呈现的信息，而非单个刺激元素。分块模型最直接的预测是针对快速呈现的信息，其中长时记忆中的存储被最小化甚至完全消除。在这种情况下，呈现信息的回忆被认为仅限于短时记忆中激活的「块」。符合这些预测，受试者能够回忆的随机字母（辅音）的数量大致与无关单词的数量相同，其中每个单词对应一个字母的「块」（G. A. Miller. 1956）。

专家与新手在记忆表现上的明显差异也以相同的方式被解释为「分块」效应。在他们对国际象棋专家卓越记忆力的先驱性研究中，Chase 和 Simon（1973）提出，经过多年的学习，国际象棋专家在长时记忆中储存了大量特定的棋子模式（即「块」）。这种记忆表征让他们能够快速识别一个棋局中的多个模式，从而依赖短时记忆中固定数量的「块」来编码和回忆多个棋子。与假设相符，即国际象棋专家的卓越记忆通过熟悉的、有意义的棋子配置实现，Chase 和 Simon 发现，当使用随机排列的棋子作为记忆任务的刺激时，专家的优势消失了。专家对其专业领域中典型刺激的卓越记忆，而非对这些刺激的随机重新排列版本的记忆，已在国际象棋（参见 Charness, 1991 年的综述）及桥牌、围棋、音乐、电子学、计算机编程、舞蹈、篮球、曲棍球和花样滑冰等领域得到验证和展示。这些研究凸显了通过长期练习和学习，在专业领域内形成的记忆模式对于提升记忆表现的重要性。

Consistent with chunking theory Chase and Simon(1973) proposed that expert memory performance could be accounted for solely in terms of STM, where chunks were temporarily kept or activated. Charness(1976) found, however, that information about chess positions was indeed stored in LTM. When other tasks were interpolated to eliminate any information about the chess position in STM, no or minimal effect on subsequent recall performance was observed. Furthermore, Frey and Adesman(1976)found that the hypothesis of a fixed number of chunks in STM was untenable for chess experts'memory of chess positions. When two chess positions were sequentially presented, their subjects recalled either one almost as well as they did after seeing only a single position. Although Frey and Adesman found some evidence for intrusion errors between the two positions, distinct memory for the two positions in LTM was demonstrated. More recently, Cooke, Atlas, Lane and Berger (1993) extended these findings and showed that highly skilled chessplayers can recall substantial amounts from up to nine different chess positions, which had been presented in sequence at a comparably fast rate of presentation. In two additional experiments Cooke et al. demonstrated that skilled chessplayers encode chess positions in terms of high-level descriptions of their structure that allow the players to distinguish memory encodings of multiple chess positions from each other.

The largest individual differences in memory performance aré associated with memory experts and professional mnemonists, whose exceptional performance reflects high acquired abilities to store specific types of information in LTM (see Ericsson, 1985, 1988)for a review). Some of the most detailed information on the structure of acquired memory skill has been collected in studies of the effects of extensive practice on the digit-span task. In this task, which was designed to measure the capacity of STM, subjects strive for complete serial recall of a rapid sequential presentation of digits. After hundreds of hours of practice on this task two subjects were able to increase their memory performance from around 7 digits, which is the typical performance of untrained subjects, to over 80 digits (Chase & Ericsson, 1982; Staszewski, 1988a). Other subjects have acquired digit spans of over 20 digits within 50 hours of practice (Chase Ericsson, 1981; Ericsson, 1988a). Detailed experimental analyses of the superior recall performance of these trained subjects show that their performance reflects storage in LTM and is limited to the specific type of material practiced. Along with increases in memory performance, the speed with which subjects can memorize a list of a given length increases and can match the presentation rates in memory tasks designed to study only STM. To attain accurate recall from LTM, subjects associate the presented items with predetermined retrieval cues(retrieval structures)during the initial presentation and then activate these retrieval cues to retrieve the items during the subsequent recall phase.

Chase 和 Simon（1973）的分块理论一致地提出，专家级的记忆表现完全可以通过短时记忆（STM）中临时保持或激活的「块」来解释。然而，Charness（1976）的研究发现，关于国际象棋位置的信息实际上是存储在长时记忆（LTM）中。当介入其他任务以排除 STM 中关于棋位的信息时，对后续回忆表现几乎没有或只有最小的影响。此外，Frey 和 Adesman（1976）的研究指出，STM 中「块」数量固定的假设并不适用于国际象棋专家记忆棋位的情况。当两个棋位依次呈现时，他们的受试者几乎可以像观察单一棋位后一样好地回忆起任何一个。虽然 Frey 和 Adesman 发现了两个位置之间一些误差的证据，但 LTM 中对这两个位置的独立记忆被证明存在。更近期的，Cooke 等人（1993）的研究进一步展示了高技能国际象棋选手能够记忆多达九个不同棋位的大量信息，这些棋位是以相当快的速度依次呈现的。在两个额外的实验中，Cooke 等人证实了熟练的国际象棋选手通过高层次的结构描述对棋位进行编码，从而能够区分多个棋位的记忆编码。

在记忆表现上最大的个体差异归因于记忆专家和专业的记忆大师，他们卓越的表现反映了在长时记忆中存储特定类型信息的高度获得能力（参见 Ericsson, 1985, 1988 年的综述）。关于获得记忆技能结构的一些最详细的信息来源于研究大量练习对数字跨度任务影响的研究。在这项旨在测量 STM 容量的任务中，受试者努力完全顺序回忆一系列快速顺序呈现的数字。经过数百小时的练习后，两名受试者将他们的记忆表现从大约 7 个数字（即未经训练的受试者的典型表现）提高到超过 80 个数字（Chase & Ericsson, 1982; Staszewski, 1988a）。其他受试者在 50 小时的练习后记忆跨度增加到超过 20 个数字（Chase & Ericsson, 1981; Ericsson, 1988a）。对这些经过训练的受试者的卓越回忆表现的详细实验分析表明，他们的表现反映了在长时记忆中的存储，并且仅限于所练习的特定类型的材料。随着记忆表现的提高，受试者记忆给定长度列表的速度增加，并能匹配仅旨在研究 STM 的记忆任务中的呈现速率。为了从长时记忆中准确回忆，受试者在初始呈现时将项目与预设的检索线索（检索结构）关联，然后在随后的回忆阶段激活这些检索线索以检索项目。

In summary, recent research on memory performance shows that with practice and the acquisition of memory skills, subjects can imprové their recal performance on a specific memory task with a particular type of stimulus material by 100 to 1000%. Their virtually perfect reproduction of presented information, especially in the digit-span task, demonstrates that after practice subjects are able to use LTM for reliable storage even at relatively fast presentation rates. The improvement is due to increased ability to store information in LTM and to the association of presented information with retrieval cues that allow reliable retrieval from LTM at the time of recall.

总结来说，最近对记忆表现的研究揭示了，通过练习和掌握记忆技巧，受试者能在特定的记忆任务上，面对特定类型的刺激材料时，将他们的回忆能力提高 100 到 1000%。特别是在数字跨度任务中所展现出的近乎完美的信息再现能力，表明受试者经过练习之后，即使面对较快的呈现速率，也能够依赖长时记忆（LTM）进行可靠的信息存储。这一显著的提升，源自于在长时记忆中存储信息能力的增强，以及将呈现信息与检索线索相关联，这种关联在回忆时使得从长时记忆中可靠地检索信息成为可能。

#### 2.3 Storage in LTM during Task-Oriented Processing

The evidence reviewed above shows that subjects can rapidly store information in retrievable form in LTM under constrained conditions. However, demonstrations of this capacity in tasks focused solely on memory performance does not prove that the same or similar mechanisms can be and are used for storage to extend working memory during skilled cognitive activities. When subjects perform a skilled cognitive activity, they focus on the goals of that activity. It is thus possible to assess storage in LTM of information relevant to that activity by stopping subjects unexpectedly and asking them to recall specific information about the preceding activity. Traditionally investigators have concentrated on incidental memory of tasks and other externally presented information, for which accuracy of recall and recognition is easy to score. Because we are interested in the detailed mechanisms of working memory, however, we should ideally analyze the activity under study so that we can predict what is relevant in the presented information and what intermediate products would need to be stored in WM for successful execution of the task.

A fairly large body of research using free-recall tests has assessed incidental memory of stimuli encountered by subjects who were completing different kinds of tasks. This research has mostly used relatively simple tasks, such as evaluations and judgments, which can be factorially combined with different stimuli. The most intriguing result was that incidental memory in some judgment tasks was as good as the memory of subjects who deliberately memorized the same stimuli (Craik Lockhart, 1972; Hyde Jenkins, 1973). Furthermore, subjects'memory for the presented stimuli did not benefit from their knowing about a subsequent recall test in advance. Hence memory of the stimuli must be a direct consequence of the cognitive process generating the judgment. In their influential theoretical framework of depth of processing Craik and Lockhart (1972)describes a general account of memory in terms of different êncoding operations within an activity. The retrieval operations should duplicate the encoding conditions in order to be effective (Moscovitch Craik, 1976) in accord with the encoding-specificity principle (Tulving, 1979).

上文回顾的证据显示，在特定条件下，受试者能够快速地以可检索的方式将信息存储在长时记忆中。但是，仅将这种能力展现在专注于记忆表现的任务中，并不能证明相同或相似的机制可被用来在执行熟练认知活动时扩展工作记忆。在进行熟练认知活动时，受试者会集中注意力于该活动的目标。因此，可以通过突然停止受试者并询问他们关于先前活动的具体信息来评估与该活动相关信息在长时记忆中的存储情况。传统上，研究者主要关注任务的非意图记忆以及其他外部呈现的信息，因其回忆和识别的准确性容易评定。然而，由于我们对工作记忆的具体机制感兴趣，我们应该对所研究的活动进行深入分析，以预测哪些呈现的信息是相关的，以及成功完成任务所需存储在工作记忆中的哪些中间产物。

利用自由回忆测试评估受试者在完成不同任务时偶遇刺激的非意图记忆的研究相当广泛。这些研究多采用相对简单的任务，比如评估和判断，这些可以与不同的刺激结合。最引人入胜的结果是，某些判断任务中的非意图记忆与有意记忆相同刺激的受试者的记忆一样好（Craik & Lockhart, 1972; Hyde & Jenkins, 1973）。此外，受试者对呈现刺激的记忆并不因为他们事先知道有即将进行的回忆测试而有所提升。因此，对刺激的记忆必然是产生判断的认知过程的直接后果。Craik 和 Lockhart（1972）在他们关于处理深度的影响力理论框架中，提出了一个关于活动中不同编码操作的通用描述。为了有效，检索操作应复制编码条件，这与编码特异性原则（Tulving, 1979）相一致。

Investigators have often used more complex tasks with greater demands on working memory, such as categorization of a large number of stimuli into several different categories. They have found high levels of incidental free recall that relate directly to the number and size of the categories of stimuli that subjects generate (Mandler, 1967). Research on expertise shows that after engaging in typical activities in their domains experts have substantial incidental memory for information relevant to their particular tasks. In his pioneering research on chess expertise, de Groot (1946/1978) found that chess masters after selecting the next move for an unfamiliar chess position could reproduce virtually the entire position as part of their verbal reports on their thought processes during the selection of the move. A subsequent experimental study by Lane and Robertson (1979) showed that chess players' memory of a chess position after the move-selection task is just as good as it is when the players have been informed about the subsequent memory test in advance. Moreover, the amount of correctly recalled information is correlated with the level of subjects'chess expertise (Charness, 1981a; Lane Robertson,1979). Mere exposure to the chess position is not sufficient to produce a good memory of it. When chess players engage in activities with a chess position that are unrelated to chess, such as counting chess pieces whose color matches that of the corresponding square, their incidental memory is minimal and prior knowledge of a subsequent memory test leads to large increases in recall performance (Lane Robertson, 1979). Unexpected recall of the configuration of cards in bridge hands yields a very similar pattern of results, and the amount of accurate incidental recall increases as a function of expertise in bridge (Charness, 1979; Engle Bukstel, 1978). Incidental memory for data on patients after a medical review and diagnosis is far greater for medical experts than for medical students(G. R. Norman, Brooks S. W. Allen, 1989). However, when the same information about patients is presented to medical experts and students who have been informed that memory test will be given afterwards, the difference in their recall performance is dramatically reduced and no longer reliable.

In sum, complex processing of stimuli leads to substantial incidental memory that subjects can successfully retrieve at the time of subsequent free recall. These results imply that a lot of relevant information is stored in LTM during the normal skilled processing for a task and that this information must have been potentially accessible during the work on that task. Free recall of information after the cognitive activity is completed does not necessarily provide an accurate estimate of the amount of information individuals can efficiently access during processing (working memory). Information in LTM can be retrieved only with the relevant cues, and not al the cues available during some cognitive activity are also spontaneously available in a free recall task (cf. Tulving Pearlstone, 1966).

研究人员经常采用更为复杂的任务来测试工作记忆，例如要求参与者将大量的刺激物分成几个不同的类别。他们发现，参与者能够在没有特意尝试记忆的情况下，回忆出与他们所创建的刺激类别的数量和大小直接相关的大量信息（Mandler, 1967）。专业领域的研究表明，专家们在完成其领域内典型活动后，能够偶然记住与其特定任务相关的大量信息。在国际象棋专长领域的开创性研究中，de Groot（1946/1978）发现，棋手在为一个陌生棋局选择下一步棋后，几乎能够完整复原整个棋局，并作为其思考过程的一部分进行口头报告。Lane 和 Robertson（1979）的后续实验研究显示，棋手在完成选择棋步任务后对棋局的记忆，与事先被告知将进行记忆测试时的记忆效果一样好。此外，正确回忆的信息量与棋手的棋艺水平正相关（Charness, 1981a; Lane Robertson,1979）。仅仅接触棋局并不足以产生对其的良好记忆。当棋手在进行与棋局无关的活动时，例如计数与棋盘格子颜色相匹配的棋子，他们的偶发记忆表现微乎其微，而且如果他们知道之后会有记忆测试，记忆表现会大幅提升（Lane Robertson, 1979）。在桥牌游戏中，对牌面配置的意外回忆显示出类似的模式，随着桥牌技能的提高，准确的偶发记忆量也会增加（Charness, 1979; Engle Bukstel, 1978）。医学专家在进行医疗审查和诊断后对患者信息的偶发记忆远超过医学生（G. R. Norman, Brooks S. W. Allen, 1989）。然而，当医学专家和被告知将进行记忆测试的学生接收到相同的患者信息时，他们的记忆表现差异显著缩小，不再显著。

总的来说，复杂的刺激处理能够导致大量的偶发记忆，参与者可以在随后的自由回忆测试中成功地检索这些信息。这表明在正常的技能处理过程中，大量相关信息被存储在长期记忆中，并且这些信息在任务进行时本应是可以被访问的。在完成认知活动后的自由回忆，并不一定能准确反映个体在处理过程中能够高效访问的信息量。只有在相关线索的帮助下，长期记忆中的信息才能被检索出来，并不是所有在认知活动期间可用的线索在自由回忆任务中都能自发地被利用（参见 Tulving Pearlstone, 1966）。

#### 2.4 Selective Retrieval of Relevant Information from STM and LTM

The distinctive functional characteristic of working memory is that from it, individuals can selectively access both relevant presented information and intermediate results they have already generated. The traditional concept of STM includes both of these types of information and hence provides an appealing account for the entire capacity of working memory. Because only a limited number of units(chunks)are activated at a given time and are therefore distinguishable from the rest of the vast amount of information stored in LTM, access of information from this small set of information in STM is not problematic. Furthermore, highly activated information is consistent with rapid and efficient access. A brief review of some of the estimated characteristics of access from STM is appropriate here because these characteristics can be used as a reference point for evaluating our proposal for access from LT-WM.

Most studies of STM have not studied representative types of retrieval from working memory but rather focused on measuring the fundamental parameters of this memory store. Speed of access is most commonly measured by recognition tests. After subjects have had some limited practice with this type of memory task (Kristofferson, 1972)information stored in STM is very rapidly recognized with search rates estimated at 25-30 items/s(Sternberg, 1969). However, the speed of recognition cannot be equated with the speed of retrieval of desired information because no new information is selectively brought into attention. The times for recognition should be viewed as lower bounds for selective retrieval.

工作记忆的一大特点是，个人能够有选择地访问他们所接受的相关信息及已产生的中间成果。传统的短期记忆（STM）观点同时包含了这两种信息类型，因此为理解工作记忆的整体容量提供了一个引人注目的解释。由于任一时刻被激活的信息单元（信息块）数量有限，从而能够与长期记忆（LTM）中存储的海量信息区分开，从而使得从短期记忆中访问这部分信息变得简单无阻。此外，高度激活的信息便于快速和高效地被获取。关于从 STM 访问信息的一些特性的简要概述在此是适宜的，因为这些特性可以作为评估我们对于长期工作记忆（LT-WM）中信息访问机制提议的一个参考。

大多数关于短期记忆的研究并未深入探讨从工作记忆中检索信息的具体方式，而是集中于测量这一记忆储存库的基础参数。访问速度通常通过识别测试来衡量。经过一定的记忆任务训练后（Kristofferson, 1972），存储于 STM 中的信息能够被极快识别，估计的搜索速率为每秒 25-30 项（Sternberg, 1969）。然而，识别速度并不能等同于检索所需信息的速度，因为此过程中并未有新信息被选择性地引入注意。因此，识别所用时间应被看作是选择性检索的最低界限。

Selective retrieval can best be studied with cued recall. In cued recall tasks, subjects retrieve an item in response to a retrieval cue provided by the experimenter. Retrieval from STM is usually elicited by the experimenter showing the subject a list of items and later asking the subject to name the item that followed a given item in the list. Sternberg(1969)found that retrieval time was a linear function of the length of the list. This result implies a search rate of 250 ms per item, which is almost ten times slower than the rate assessed for recognition. Several investigators (Weber Blagowsky, 1970; Weber Castleman, 1969; Weber, Cross Carleton, 1968) have attained similar estimates for retrieval from STM. Weber and his colleagues have noted that the search rates are very close to the speed of internal speech (Weber & Bach, 1969). According to chunking theory not all information about the chunks is stored in STM. Instead a general pointer or retrieval cue is stored in STM that allows the subject at the time of recall to access information from the chunk in LTM. The time necessary to retrieve all the elements of a single chunk was estimated by Yu, W. Zhang, Jing, Peng, G. Zhang and Simon (1985) to range from 281 ms to 373 ms. Hence, selective retrieval of information"stored in STM" is far from immediate, and combined search and retrieval might require a duration of around a second.

The time it takes to access information stored in LTM is generally estimated from the difference between recognition times for items previously stored in LTM and for just seen items that are retained in active form in STM. As noted earlier, storage in LTM is not generally immediate for typical laboratory stimuli, and for lists of unrelated items investigators provide subjects with study times sufficient for storage in LTM prior to a test of recognition. Sternberg (1969) found that recognition times for highly practiced lists stored in LTM were 200 ms to 400 ms longer than those for items stored in STM, depending on the length of the list (up to five items long). For meaningful materials such as sentences, storage in LTM occurs typically after a single presentation. In recognition tests of sentences Anderson (1990)found that access to sentences stored in LTM takes somewhat longer than it does for just seen sentences stored in STM. An additional 420 ms is required for sentences stored after a single presentation. For sentences studied at two different times the estimated retrieval time is reduced to 280 ms(Anderson, 1990).

通过提示回忆的方式，我们能够更好地研究选择性的信息检索。在这类任务中，实验者提供一个提示，参与者需根据这个提示回忆出特定的信息。通常，从短期记忆（STM）中检索信息是通过展示一个列表并稍后要求参与者说出列表中某个特定项后面的项来实现的。Sternberg（1969）的研究发现，检索时间随列表长度线性增长。这意味着每个项的搜索时间大约为 250 毫秒，几乎是识别任务中评估速率的十倍。其他研究者也得到了与从 STM 检索相关的类似估计。Weber 及其同事指出，这些搜索速率与内部语速非常接近。根据信息块（chunk）理论，不是所有有关信息块的信息都存储在 STM 中。相反，STM 中存储了一个总览指针或提示，使得在回忆时，参与者可以从长期记忆（LTM）中的信息块获取信息。Yu, W. Zhang, Jing, Peng, G. Zhang 和 Simon（1985）估计，检索一个信息块的所有元素所需的时间介于 281 毫秒到 373 毫秒之间。因此，从 STM 中检索「存储的」信息远非瞬间完成的，整个搜索和检索过程可能需要大约一秒钟。

通常通过比较之前存储在长期记忆（LTM）中的项目的识别时间与刚看到、保留在 STM 中的项目的识别时间差异来估计从 LTM 检索信息所需的时间。如前所述，对于实验室刺激，LTM 的存储通常不会立即发生，对于不相关的项目列表，研究者会给予足够的学习时间，以便在进行识别测试之前，这些信息能够被存储于 LTM 中。Sternberg（1969）发现，存储在 LTM 中的经过大量练习的列表的识别时间，根据列表长度的不同，比存储在 STM 中的项的识别时间要长 200 到 400 毫秒。对于有意义的材料，比如句子，在一次呈现后通常就会存储在 LTM 中。Anderson（1990）在对句子进行识别测试时发现，访问存储在 LTM 中的句子所需的时间略长于刚刚看到并存储在 STM 中的句子。对于单次呈现后存储的句子，需要额外 420 毫秒。而对于在两次不同时间学习的句子，估计的检索时间减少到 280 毫秒。

Measurement of retrieval speed in studies of cued recall of information in LTM are remarkably rare. When unrelated paired associates such as foreign vocabulary items, are learned subjects need a fair amount of study time. Even after considerable study time cued-retrieval times are slow--typically around 2 s (Crutcher, 1990)-and only after extensive retrieval practice are access times below 1 s (Crutcher, 1992). With more familiar materials, such as paired associates of one-syllable English words Waugh (1985) found that retrieval times were around 800 ms after the first study trial and decreased to around 400 ms after 18 practice blocks, which was indistinguishable from the times taken to read the stimulus words aloud.

As we stated earlier, the use of LTM as an extension of working memory is possible only under very restricted circumstances. Subjects must be able to rapidly store information in LTM, an ability that requires extensive experience and a large body of relevant knowledge and patterns for the particular type of information involved. Our review showed that such abilities are primarily observed in memory experts and other types of experts for specific domains. Furthermore the activity has to be very familiar to the experts because only then can they accurately anticipate future retrieval demands for information. These conditions allow selective storage of information. Finally subjects associate the encoded information with appropriate retrieval cues, which allow them at a later time to activate a particular retrieval cue thus partially re-instating the conditions of encoding to retrieve the desired information from LTM. When a set of retrieval cues are organized in a stable structure we will refer to that structure as a retrieval structure. The acquired memory skill involves the development of encodings for which the subject can provide controlled access to significant aspects of the encoding context and thus indirectly to the desired information in manner consistent with the encoding- specificity principle(Tulving, 1983).. Hence the particular instanciation of LT-WM in a given activity wil correspond to a domain-specific memory skiîl that wil differ considerably in its specific structure from memory skills in other activities. The difficulty of examining LT-WM in detail during experts' performance of representative tasks in their domain of expertise is due to the complexity of the pre- requisite knowledge and the corresponding tasks. Later in this paper we discuss the structure of LT- WM during text comprehension and in different forms of expert performance in various domains.

At a very general level we can characterize LT-WM as mediated by a retrieval schema, in which information the subject has encountered is encoded and stored in LTM, where it is associated with its appropriate retrieval cues as illustrated in Figure 1.

在研究长期记忆中信息的提示回忆时，关于检索速度的测量非常少见。例如，在学习外语单词等不相关配对信息时，受试者需要较长的学习时间。即便经过大量的学习，基于提示的检索时间仍然很慢 —— 通常约为 2 秒（Crutcher, 1990），只有在经过大量的检索练习之后，访问时间才能缩短到 1 秒以下（Crutcher, 1992）。对于更熟悉的材料，比如单音节英文单词的配对，Waugh（1985）发现，第一次学习尝试后的检索时间大约为 800 毫秒，并且在进行了 18 轮练习后降至大约 400 毫秒，与大声读出刺激词的时间没有显著区别。

正如我们之前所讨论的，把长期记忆作为工作记忆的延伸，只有在非常有限的条件下才可能实现。这要求受试者能够迅速将信息存储进长期记忆，这一能力需要丰富的经验和大量的相关知识及模式。我们的综述表明，这种能力主要在记忆专家和其他特定领域的专家中表现出来。而且，仅当活动对专家非常熟悉时，他们才能准确预见到未来的信息检索需求，这为信息的选择性存储提供了可能。最终，受试者会将编码信息与合适的检索提示联系起来，使得在后期可以激活特定的检索提示，从而在一定程度上重建编码时的条件，以从长期记忆中检索所需信息。当一组检索提示按照一种稳定的结构组织时，我们称之为「检索结构」。所获得的记忆技巧涉及到对编码的控制访问，使受试者可以间接地、以一种符合编码特异性原则（Tulving, 1983）的方式访问所需信息。因此，给定活动中长期工作记忆的具体实现将对应于一个领域特定的记忆技能，它在其特定结构上与其他活动中的记忆技能大相径庭。详细检查专家在其专业领域内执行代表性任务时的长期工作记忆的复杂性，是因为所需的前置知识和相应任务的复杂性。在本文后面，我们将讨论在文本理解和不同领域内各种形式的专家表现中长期工作记忆的结构。

总的来说，我们可以将长期工作记忆描述为通过一个检索模式进行中介的过程，这个过程中，受试者遇到的信息被编码并存储在长期记忆中，并与其对应的检索提示相关联。

Encoded Information 

At the time of selective recall only the node corresponding to this specific structure needs to be available in STM, along with the retrieval cue specifying the type of desired information. For example, a medical doctor reviewing a chart for a patient selectively encodes that patient's test results in LT-WM to allow retrieval of that information from memory when that test result is relevant and specified by a corresponding retrieval cue.

Most of our current knowledge about LT-WM came originally from studies of exceptional recall of digits. In this task the demands for future retrieval are unusually clear: subjects are asked to reproduce all the digits in the exact order presented. Based on an intensive study of the encoding processes used by a subject, SF, who through training had acquired an exceptional digit span, Chase and Ericsson (1981) were able to assess a hierarchical retrieval organization that SF used to memorize lists of 30 digits shown in Figure 2. At the lowest level SF used mnemonic association to running times and other numerical relations to group digits and encode them as units. SF then used spatial relations to encode digit groups into super-groups.

在选择性记忆的过程中，只需短时记忆 (STM) 中的特定结构相对应的节点处于活跃状态，同时还需要一个明确指出想要获取的信息类型的检索提示。比如，当医生查看病人的病历时，他会有选择地把病人的检查结果编入长期工作记忆 (LT-WM)，这样当需要这些检查结果时，就可以通过一个相关的检索提示来从记忆中提取出来。

我们对长期工作记忆 (LT-WM) 的大多数现有知识，最初是源自于对数字记忆力异常人群的研究。在这项研究中，未来的检索需求被非常明确地提出：参与者被要求按照展示的确切顺序重复所有数字。通过对一位经过训练，具有非凡数字记忆跨度的受试者 SF 的编码过程进行深入研究，Chase 和 Ericsson（1981 年）揭示了 SF 使用的一种层次化的记忆检索组织方法来记住 30 个数字，这些数字如图 2 所示。在最基本的层面，SF 通过将数字与跑步时间和其他数值关系联系起来进行助记编码，将这些数字分组并作为单元存储。然后，SF 利用空间关系把这些数字分组编码成更大的组合。

At the time of recall, SF could easily regenerate any of the unique locations of the retrieval structure and use a given location as a cue to retrieve the corresponding digit group.

By proceeding sequentially through a retrieval structure, subjects can serially recall all of the digits in their presented order. Directly relevant to the characteristics of working memory, Chase and Ericsson(1981) found that the digits groups were accessible when descriptions of their location within the retrieval structure were used as cues. Chase and Ericsson demonstrated this form of accessibility experimentally in a cued recall task. After the subject had memorized a digit sequence,the experimenter presented locations in the retrieval structure and asked the subject to recall the corresponding digit group or asked the subject to point to the location of a presented digit group. With more extensive practice on the digit-span task the same type of retrieval by a second subject (DD)has been found to be virtually immediate (Staszewski, 1988a). 

Further evidence for this immediate and flexible retrieval through retrieval structures is shown by these trained subjects' ability to memorize matrices of digits without any additional practice, and in particular to retrieve those digits in many different recall orders, as illustrated in Figure 3.

在进行回忆时，SF 能够轻松重现检索结构中的任一特定位置，并利用这一位置作为线索，回忆出对应的数字群组。

通过顺序地遍历检索结构，参与者能够按照原始顺序依次回忆出所有数字。直接关联到工作记忆的特性，Chase 和 Ericsson (1981) 发现，当利用检索结构内的位置描述作为线索时，数字群组可以被轻松访问。Chase 和 Ericsson 通过一个提示性回忆实验任务，展示了这种访问方式。实验中，一旦受试者记忆了一串数字，实验者就展示检索结构中的某个位置，并要求受试者回忆出与之对应的数字群组，或指出已呈现数字群组的具体位置。随着在数字记忆广度任务上练习的深入，第二位受试者 (DD) 展示了几乎即刻的相同类型检索能力（Staszewski, 1988a）。

这些接受训练的受试者能够在无需额外练习的情况下记忆数字矩阵，并特别能够以多种不同的顺序回忆这些数字，从而显示了通过检索结构实现即时和灵活回忆的进一步证据，正如图 3 所示。

The trained subjects memorized the matrix in terms of five digit groups, each digit group corresponding to a different row. The speed of these subjects' storage and flexible recall matched that of the exceptional subjects studied by Binet(1894) and Luria (1968)and thus meets the criteria specified by these investigators for exceptional visual/photographic memory. However, both trained and exceptional subjects' times to recall the matrix were found to be a linear function of the number of times they had to retrieve a different digit group (row) to complete recall according to the specified order (Ericsson Chase, 1982). The time required to recall a new digit group was estimated to be about 2 s, but a subject familiar with this particular recall task completed the retrieval within 1 s (Müller, 1917). Other studies of memory experts and subjects with alleged exceptional memory recall (reviewed by Ericsson 1985, 1988a) almost always yield evidence for the explicit use of retrieval structures in exceptional serial recall. Often the retrieval structures are hierarchies of spatial locations, but frequently subjects rely on a sequence of locations, as in the method of loci (Yates, 1966).

In sum, we argue that selective retrieval of information stored in LTM after a brief single presentation can be achieved with appropriate retrieval cues at speeds comparable to those for retrieval from STM. Hence working memory based on storage in and retrieval from LTM could attain through practice storage and retrieval speeds similar to those for STM.

The Chase-Ericsson (1982) proposal for Skilled Memory has been generally accepted as a mechanism for accounting for exceptional memory (Anderson, 1990; Baddeley, 1990; Carpenter and Just, 1989; Newell, 1990; Walter Schneider Detweiler, 1987; van Lehn, 1989), but several investigators have voiced doubts about its generalizability to working memory. Carpenter and Just (1989) wrote that "Memorizing a sequence of digits this way shares some properties of language comprehension, namely the circumvention of working-memory limitations by on-line binding of successive elements to a hierarchical knowledge structure."(p.54). However, they argued that, unlike sentence comprehension, "the knowledge structure to which the digits are bound is fairly inflexible and typically known before hand"(p. 54). Walter Schneider and Detweiler (1987) argued that "it is important not to use LTM as working memory. This is because the faster LTM is changed, the greater the likelihood that retroactive interference will distort all the previously stored LTM, making it useless" (p.84). In support of the claim that working memory of experts does not rely on LTM, Baddeley (1990)interprets the finding that expert abacus calculators are unable to recall more than one sequence of presented digits (Hatano & Osawa, 1983) as evidence against any mediation of storage in LTM for their exceptionally large working memory capacity for numbers. In the next section we will try to show that Chase-Éricsson's Skilled Memory Theory can be extended into our conception of LT-WM that successfully addresses these concerns.

这些受过训练的受试者采用了五个数字组的记忆方法来记忆矩阵，每个数字组代表一行。这种记忆和灵活回忆的速度，与 Binet（1894 年）和 Luria（1968 年）研究的那些拥有异常视觉 / 摄影记忆能力的受试者相媲美，满足了这些研究者对于非凡记忆能力的定义标准。不过，不论是经过训练的还是拥有非凡记忆的受试者，他们完成指定顺序回忆的时间都与他们检索不同数字组的次数呈线性关系（Ericsson Chase，1982）。回忆一个新数字组所需的时间大约为 2 秒，但熟悉这种特定回忆任务的受试者可以在 1 秒内完成（Müller，1917）。其他研究表明，无论是记忆专家还是声称具有异常记忆能力的受试者，他们几乎总是通过使用检索结构来实现序列回忆的，这些检索结构通常是空间位置的层级结构，或者是像在记忆宫殿法中使用的位置序列（Yates，1966）。

总的来说，我们认为，仅通过简短的一次性展示后存储在长期记忆中的信息，可以通过恰当的检索线索以接近短期记忆检索速度的速度进行选择性检索。因此，通过练习，基于长期记忆存储和检索的工作记忆，可以实现与短期记忆相近的存储和检索速度。

Chase-Ericsson（1982 年）对熟练记忆的理论已经被广泛接受，作为解释非凡记忆能力的一种机制（Anderson, 1990; Baddeley, 1990; Carpenter and Just, 1989; Newell, 1990; Walter Schneider Detweiler, 1987; van Lehn, 1989）。但是，一些研究者对其能否广泛应用于工作记忆表示了怀疑。Carpenter 和 Just（1989）指出，这种记忆数字序列的方法具有一些语言理解的特性，即通过将连续元素在线绑定到一个层级知识结构上，来绕过工作记忆的限制。然而，他们认为，与句子理解不同的是，这种方法中数字绑定的知识结构比较固定，通常是事先已知的。Walter Schneider 和 Detweiler（1987）强调，不应将长期记忆作为工作记忆来使用，因为长期记忆的变动越快，就越可能出现逆向干扰，扭曲所有之前存储的长期记忆，导致其变得无用。Baddeley（1990）通过解释算盘高手无法回忆多于一组数字序列的现象（Hatano & Osawa, 1983），作为他们异常大的工作记忆容量不依赖于长期记忆存储的证据。在下一部分，我们将展示 Chase-Éricsson 的熟练记忆理论如何能够被扩展到我们的长期工作记忆概念中，成功地解决了这些疑虑。

#### 2.5 Proactive Interference in Long-Term Working Memory

Efficient LT-WM requires that the skilled performer be able to anticipate future retrieval demands and thus identify and refine retrieval cues that uniquely index selected information. By reactivating the corresponding retrieval cue the skilled performer can access the desired information in memory. This mechanism should provide controlled retrieval as long as a given retrieval cue is associated with only a single piece of information. In many skilled activities, however, results generated during a task are frequently transformed and modified, or a series of similar tasks are performed within a relatively short time period. Hence the same retrieval cue is linked to several different results in succession. In this case the retrieval cue should access only the most recently stored result. Theories of LTM predict considerable proactive interference from previously stored results and therefore a small likelihood of reliable retrieval from LT-WM under such circumstances. Inaccessibility due to interference is also postulated as an important cause of forgetting in LT-WM.In spite of these well-known findings our proposal for LT-WM is sometimes incorrectly believed to imply extended accessibility to all results stored in LTM regardless of intermediate activities. Hence a plausible model of LT-WM needs to demonstrate how the effects of interference can be overcome by distinct temporal separation and supplementary memory encodings.

It is well established that subjects can repeatedly use the same retrieval structure, such as the method of loci or pegwords, to encode successive lists of words and still be able to retrieve the most recently studied items (Bellezza, 1982). In a recent review Baddeley and Hitch(1993)showed that superior recall of the most recent experiences of some type is a very general phenomenon and has been successfully related to the temporal separation of the experiences over time periods ranging from seconds to months. As long as the temporal separation between the most recent encoding and the previous encodings is sufficient to make it distinctive, retrieval is accurate.

高效的长期工作记忆（LT-WM）的关键在于，熟练者必须能够预测将来可能需要回溯的信息，因此需要识别和精细化能够唯一指向特定信息的线索。通过重新激活这些检索线索，熟练者就能够从记忆中找到他们需要的信息。只要一个检索线索只指向一条信息，这个机制就能保证检索的准确性。然而，在很多技能要求高的活动中，任务产生的结果经常需要被转换和修改，或者在短时间内反复执行类似的任务。这就导致同一个检索线索可能会依次关联到多个不同的结果。在这种情形下，检索线索应该只能找到最新存储的信息。长期记忆（LTM）的理论指出，早期存储的信息可能会对新信息造成强烈的干扰，因此在这些情况下从长期工作记忆中准确地提取信息的可能性非常小。干扰导致的无法访问信息也是长期工作记忆中遗忘的一个主要原因。尽管存在这些已知的问题，我们对长期工作记忆的看法有时会被误解，认为它能够无限制地访问长期记忆中的所有信息，不考虑中间进行的活动。因此，一个合理的长期工作记忆模型需要展示，通过时间上的明显分隔和额外的记忆编码，如何克服干扰的影响。

已经有证据表明，人们可以多次使用同样的记忆结构，比如场所法或钉子词法来编码一系列的词汇，然后仍能够准确地回忆出最近学习的项目（Bellezza, 1982）。Baddeley 和 Hitch（1993）在他们最近的综述中指出，某类经历的最新回忆通常表现得更好，这是一个广泛存在的现象，并且与经历之间的时间间隔长短紧密相关，无论是几秒钟还是几个月。只要最近的编码和之前的编码之间有足够的时间间隔来使其显得独特，那么检索就会非常准确。

Temporal separation may also be important for explaining a finding from the Brown-Peterson paradigm that has been very dificult to explain by traditional theories of ŠTM (Crowder, 1993). On the first trial with the Brown-Peterson paradigm, subjects'recall of presented information is quite accurate and does not decay as a function of the length of time they spend on the interpolated activity. Only after three or four repeated trials has sufficient proactive interference been accumulated to induce the typical decay of recall that occurs as a function of the time spent on the distracting activity. Walter Schneider and Detweiler (1987) showed that temporal distinctiveness (recency) could account for this phenomenon. They also found in a review of earlier studies that long intertrial intervals of around 2 m between successive Brown-Peterson trials essentially eliminate interference and restore recall to the level of the first trial of the session. If we assume that the presented information can be encoded by associations to corresponding category cues, so that the category cues serve as retrieval cues for subsequent recall, we can extend the recency mechanism to explain other related findings involving presented instances of distinct categories. We can account for the release of proactive interference due to an experimental change in the category of presented instances (Wickens, Born C. K. Allen, 1963) and also for multiple recency effects for different categories after presentation of mixed lists(Watkins & Peynircioglu, 1983).

The preferred laboratory paradigm for studying interference involves presenting paired associates, where the stimulus item of the associate is recombined (updated) with different response items. Within this paradigm recall for the most recently presented response is typically measured using the stimulus item as a cue, but it is also possible to measure final recall of all the presented responses for a given stimulus item. The pattern of performance on these two recall tasks is dramatically influenced by the subjects' encoding methods (Bjork, 1978). When subjects memorize the paired associates by ordered rehearsal, the typical pattern of interference is obtained: cued recall of the most recent responses is accurate but old responses couldn't be recalled at the final memory test (study by Bjork and McClure reported in Bjork, 1978). Other subjects in the same experiment were instructed to memorize responses to the same stimulus item by constructing a story the interrelated all the responses in the order presented. Cued recall of the most recent responses for this group of subjects matched that of the group using ordered rehearsal, but final recall of all responses was much higher and close to the level of recall for the most recent responses. Bjork (1978) summarized a large body of research and concluded that all methods of encoding associated with updating have positive and negative features and only in the context of the retrieval demands for a particular task can the best method be selected.

时间间隔对于理解 Brown-Peterson 范式中一个长期难以用传统短时记忆（STM）理论解释的现象非常关键。Crowder 在 1993 年提到，在使用 Brown-Peterson 范式的首次实验中，受试者对展示的信息记忆得相当准确，并且他们在间隔活动上花费的时间长度并不会导致记忆的衰减。只有经过三到四轮重复实验，才积累了足够的主动干扰（proactive interference），导致了记忆衰减的典型现象，这种衰减是基于分心活动所花费时间的。Walter Schneider 和 Detweiler 在 1987 年展示了，时间上的显著性（recency）可以解释这个现象。他们还发现，早期研究回顾表明，连续的 Brown-Peterson 试验之间约 2 分钟的长间隔几乎消除了干扰，并将记忆恢复到实验开始的第一轮试验的水平。如果我们假设展示的信息可以通过与相应的类别线索关联而被编码，这样类别线索就作为后续记忆的检索线索，我们就能通过最近性机制来解释涉及特定类别示例的其他相关发现。例如，由于实验中改变了展示实例的类别，导致主动干扰的释放（Wickens, Born C. K. Allen, 1963），以及在混合列表呈现后不同类别的多重最近性效应（Watkins & Peynircioglu, 1983）也能得到解释。

研究干扰的标准实验方法包括展示成对联想，其中联想的刺激项会与不同的响应项重新组合（更新）。在此范式中，通常使用刺激项作为线索来测量最新展示的响应的记忆，但也可以测量针对给定刺激项所有展示响应的最终记忆。受试者的编码策略显著影响了这两种记忆任务上的表现模式（Bjork, 1978）。当受试者通过有序重复来记忆成对联想时，就会出现典型的干扰模式：最近响应的提示记忆准确，但在最终记忆测试中，早期的响应无法被回忆。而在同一实验中，另一组受试者被指导通过构建故事来记忆对同一个刺激项的响应，故事将所有响应以呈现的顺序相互关联。这组受试者对最新响应的提示记忆与使用有序重复的组相匹配，但所有响应的最终记忆更高，几乎达到了对最新响应记忆的水平。Bjork 在 1978 年总结了大量研究，并得出结论，所有与更新相关的编码方法都各有优劣，只有在特定任务的检索需求下，才能选出最佳方法。

In many cases it is important to overcome interference form several different items associated with the same concept or retrieval cue by generating an integrated memory representation including all items. One effective method to achieve integration for unrelated words is the story-construction mnemonic discussed above. This method has a long history in memory research and is effective to memorize a list of words or store many items in the same physical location in the method of loci(See Bower, 1972, for a review). A similar type of integration is now also established in one of the dominant paradigms for studying the effects of interference in LTM--the fan effect for recognition of studied facts. In this original paradigm Anderson (1974) had subjects memorize a series of sentences. Each sentence has a subject placed in a location, such as "The hippie is in the park", "The lawyer is in the park", and "The hippie is in the bank". The key finding was that the time to correctly recognize a given sentence increased as a function of the number of occurrences(fan)of that sentence's subject and location descriptions among the other sentences. Although the fan effect is highly reproducible with facts memorized independently, it is reduced (Moeser, 1979; E. E. Smith, Ädams & Schorr, 1978)or even reversed (Myers, O'Brien, Balota & Toyofuku, 1984) for a series of sentences that forms an integrated representation, such as an episode of christening a ship. When subjects memorize sentences for multiple themes, a fan effect for the number of different themes emerges, but the number of irrelevant facts does not have a reliable influence (Reder Ross, 1983). Pre-experimental information used to generate the integrated encodings is proposed to be a major factor mediating the increased recognition performance for integrated facts (Jones Anderson, 1987). Recently, Radvansky and Zacks (1991)have found an intriguing asymmetry for sentences describing the location of objects. Recognition times for a sentence shows no fan effect for the number of other objects in the same location, whereas the number of locations associated with a given object leads to a typical fan. They propose that it is possible to store objects in the same location in an integrated memory representation similar to a mental model (Johnson-Laird, 1983), and we would add a situation model (van Dijk Kintsch, 1983). It is doesn't appear possible to integrate several different locations associated with the same object in a similar manner, at least not for arbitrary spatial locations. In our subsequent section on text comprehension we will show that the generation of integrated memory representations is the normal mode of processing texts on familiar topics.

在许多情况下，通过创建一个包含所有相关项目的综合记忆表示，来克服由同一概念或检索线索相关联的多个不同项目所产生的干扰非常重要。一种有效整合无关单词的方法是之前讨论过的故事构建助记法（story-construction mnemonic）。这种方法在记忆研究中拥有悠久的历史，并且在记住一个单词列表或在场所法（method of loci）中在同一物理位置存储多个项目时非常有效（参考 Bower, 1972 年的综述）。现在，在研究长期记忆（LTM）中干扰效应的一个主要范式 —— 识别学习事实的扇效应（fan effect）中，也确立了类似的整合方式。在这一原始范式中，Anderson（1974）让受试者记忆了一系列句子，每个句子描述一个主体位于某个位置，比如「嬉皮士在公园里」、「律师在公园里」和「嬉皮士在银行里」。关键的发现是，随着某句子的主体和位置描述在其他句子中出现的次数（也就是扇面的数量）增加，正确识别该句子所需的时间也增加。尽管扇效应在独立记忆的事实上高度可重现，但对于形成了一个综合表示的句子序列，比如一艘船的命名仪式，这一效应会减少甚至逆转。当受试者记忆涉及多个主题的句子时，会出现不同主题数量的扇效应，但无关事实的数量对结果没有可靠的影响。生成综合编码的实验前信息被认为是提高综合事实识别性能的一个主要因素。最近，Radvansky 和 Zacks（1991）在描述物体位置的句子中发现了一个有趣的不对称现象。对于一个句子的识别时间，同一位置的其他物体数量没有显示扇效应，而与一个给定物体相关联的位置数量则产生了典型的扇效应。他们提出，可能在类似于心理模型的综合记忆表示中存储在同一位置的物体，并且我们还可以增加一个情境模型。似乎不可能以相同的方式整合与同一物体相关联的多个不同位置，至少对于随意的空间位置是这样的。在我们接下来关于文本理解的部分中，我们将展示生成综合记忆表示是处理熟悉话题文本的常规方式。

Comparatively little attention has been directed toward the effects of interference in working memory of skilled performers. Chase and Ericsson (1982)found that the performance of their trained memory experts was influenced by interference in several ways. In their procedure for testing digit span, consecutive digit lists had nearly the same number of digits and thus required the use of the same retrieval structure. On the first memory trial of a session, when proactive interference from other memorized digit lists was minimal, our subject was more likely to recall the digit list perfectly than he was on subsequent memory trials, for which the probability of perfect recall was considerably lower. However, the decrement in the total number of correctly recalled digits was small, a result suggesting that inference has a reliable, yet limited, influence.

The influence of interference is more dramatic during post-session recall of previously presented lists. Chase and Ericsson(1981, 1982)found that although their trained subjects were able to recall the majority of all presented 3- and 4-digit groups during post-session recall, they were typically unable to recall the exact sequence of entire lists of presented digits except for the last one or two lists. For the post-session recall the subjects used the mnemonic categories of running times as retrieval cues rather than the retrieval structure itself. Hence proactive interference restricted the retrievability of previously presented lists through retrieval structure cues. In a direct test of the effects of maximal interference, Chase and Ericsson(1982) tested DD on a paradigm related to one used by Frey and Adesman(1976) for recall of chess positions. First, one list of digits was presented. After a brief pause another list of the same length was presented and immediately recalled. Only then was the first list recalled. Under those conditions DD recalled the second list virtually perfectly, but was also able to recall most of the first list correctly. Recall accuracy for the first list ranged from virtually perfect to around 70%, which incidentally is close to the decrement originally observed by Frey and Adesman(1976)for chess experts'recall of chess positions. From concurrent reports that the trained subjects gave during memorization and recall of the digits, Chase and Ericsson determined that these subjects encode not only the digit groups together with their retrieval cues, but also higher-level relations between mnemonic categories within and between supergroups. For example, the first four 4-digit groups in the first supergroup (see Figure 2) was described in a retrospective report by one of the trained subjects as um, the whole first four groups of four, it just went two ages, mile, mile two ages, and the miles were similar and the two ages were similar, so I was just set on that (Staszewski, 1990, p. 259)". Hence the trained subject encoded patterns of mnemonic codes to build a structure in LTM of the digit sequences(see Chase Ericsson, 1982, and Staszewski, 1990, for a review of the extensive empirical evidence). Figure 1 must thus be augmented with additional encodings that generate associations forming a new memory structure connected to most of the digits in the list, as shown in Figure 4.

尽管研究界对熟练表演者如何处理工作记忆中的干扰给予了相对较少的关注，但 Chase 和 Ericsson 在 1982 年的研究发现，这些训练有素的记忆专家在面对干扰时，他们的记忆表现会受到多方面的影响。他们通过一个特定的测试程序 —— 要求受试者回忆一系列几乎长度相同的数字串 —— 揭示了这一点。在一次记忆任务的首轮尝试中，如果受试者此前没接触过太多类似的数字列表，他们回忆得较为完美；但在随后的尝试中，由于数字列表之间的干扰，完美回忆的可能性显著降低。然而，干扰导致的记忆准确度下降幅度并不大，这表明干扰虽然确实会影响记忆，但这种影响是有限的。

更有趣的是，在会议结束后回忆之前呈现的数字列表时，干扰的影响变得更加显著。Chase 和 Ericsson 的发现表明，尽管受训者能够回忆出大多数 3 位和 4 位数的组合，但除了最后一两个列表外，他们通常难以准确回忆出完整列表的确切顺序。在会后回忆时，受试者倾向于使用与跑步时间相关的记忆类别作为线索，而非依赖于他们的常规检索结构。这说明了，由于前向干扰，通过常规的检索结构线索来回忆先前的列表变得更加困难。

在一项专门设计来测试极端干扰效应的实验中，Chase 和 Ericsson 让一位名为 DD 的受试者参与了一个类似于 Frey 和 Adesman 在 1976 年用于测试象棋位置记忆的实验。实验过程中，首先呈现一个数字列表，随后短暂暂停，再呈现另一个长度相同的列表并立即回忆。只有在那之后，才回忆第一个列表。在这种情况下，DD 几乎完美地回忆了第二个列表，并且也能够正确回忆出大部分第一个列表。这一结果与 Frey 和 Adesman 观察到的象棋大师回忆象棋位置的准确度下降相似，准确率从几乎完美到大约 70% 不等。

根据训练有素的受试者在记忆和回忆过程中提供的同时报告，Chase 和 Ericsson 发现，这些受试者不仅将数字组及其检索线索编码在一起，而且还编码了记忆类别内部以及不同记忆类别组之间的更高级别的关系。例如，一位受训者在回顾性报告中描述了他是如何将第一个大组中的前四个 4 位数字组联想在一起的，这种方式便于他记忆和回忆。这表明，通过编码数字序列和相关的助记码之间的模式和关系，受训者能够在长期记忆中构建出一种新的记忆结构。

Patterns and Schemas

In addition to the direct associations between the encoded information and retrieval cues, subjects build a unique structure in LTM where the elements are directly related by semantic relations. From these findings we hypothesize that this generated structure will be relatively immune to proactive interference. Moreover, an element in this structure combined with cues in the retrieval structure should allow constrained recall of information belonging to this specific structure. 

In sum, our proposal for LT-WM includes cue-based retrieval without additional encodings (see Figure 1) and cue-based retrieval with an elaborated structure associating items from a given trial or context (see Figure 4). The demands a given activity makes on working memory dictate which encoding method, that is retrieval structure or elaborated memory structure or a combination of the two, as illustrated in Figure 4, individuals are likely to choose so as to attain reliable and rapid storage and access of information in LT-WM, and thereby determine the structure of the acquired memory skill. The mechanism of STM accounts for working memory in unfamiliar activities, but does not appear to provide sufficient storage capacity for working memory in skilled complex activities. One possible explanation is that the general storage capacity is greater for specific skilled activities than unfamiliar ones. A more parsimonious account, however, is that storage in working memory can be increased and is one of many skills attained during the acquisition of skilled performance. Our proposal for LT-WM is consistent with this account. Also consistent with the conclusion that the superiority of expert memory and of exceptional memory is domain-specific, our proposal asserts that increased working memory is limited to the specific skilled activity in question. The acquired nature of LT-WM implies differences between tasks and in addition potential individual differences in the implementation of LT-WM for a given task. This raises new theoretical and methodological challenges for research on working memory to which we will now turn.

除了直接将编码的信息与检索线索相关联外，受试者还能在长期记忆中构建一个独特的结构，这个结构的元素通过意义上的联系紧密相连。从这项发现出发，我们推测，这样构建的结构对于前向干扰来说相对较为抵抗。进一步地，结构中的某个元素，如果与检索结构中的线索结合，就能够有选择性地回忆出属于这个特殊结构的信息。

总的来说，我们对长期工作记忆（LT-WM）的构想既包括了基于线索的检索，无需额外的编码（如图 1 所示），也涉及到了通过详细结构进行的基于线索的检索，这种结构将来自特定试验或情境的信息项联系起来（如图 4 所示）。一个特定活动对工作记忆的需求将指导采用哪种编码方法 —— 无论是检索结构、复杂的记忆结构，还是两者的结合（如图 4 展示的），以实现信息在长期工作记实中的可靠快速存取，进而确定掌握的记忆技巧的结构。短期记忆（STM）机制解释了面对不熟悉活动时工作记忆的运作，但似乎对于熟练的复杂活动中的工作记忆而言，其存储能力并不足够。一种可能的理解是，对于特定熟练活动，总体存储能力超过了对不熟悉活动的存储需求。然而，更简洁的解释是，通过习得熟练表现的过程，工作记忆的存储能力能够提升，这也是获得的众多技能之一。我们的长期工作记忆方案正与此相符。此外，与认为专家记忆和非凡记忆具有领域特定性的结论一致，我们认为，工作记忆的增强只限于特定的熟练活动。长期工作记忆的习得性意味着，不同任务之间，以及个体在特定任务的长期工作记忆实施中可能存在差异。这为工作记忆的研究带来了新的理论与方法学上的挑战，我们接下来将探讨这些挑战。

### 03. Toward a Theoretical Framework of Working Memory

According to our proposal LT-WM is not a generalizable capacity that, once acquired,can supplement ST-WM in any cognitive activity. LT-WM is acquired in particular domains to meet specific demands on storage and retrieval that a given activity imposes. LT-WM must therefore be discussed in the context of specific skilled activities. To provide this context, we first discuss the general structure of cognitive processes.

Cognitive processes can be described as a sequence of states or thoughts. Memory mediates between the states of this sequence. Cognitive states are dependent on each other, and memory generates this dependency, as do environmental correlations.

Memory plays another role that must be noted and differentiated. Thoughts the cognitive states- are themselves the end products of complex generation processes. Typically, sensory and perceptual as well as conceptual operations are involved in the genesis of cognitive states, which requires knowledge activation and elaboration processes at various levels. In order for a higher level process to use the output of a lower level process, that output must remain available for at least some minimal amount of time. This availability is achieved through process-specific memory buffers that contain for a limited amount of time the results of the intermediate processes that generate the end product, or the cognitive state. We distinguish these buffers for the storage of intermediate results from the role of memory as a mediator between successive cognitive states.

根据我们的研究建议，长期工作记忆（LT-WM）并非一种一旦掌握即可广泛应用于任何认知活动的通用技能。它是在特定领域中为了满足某项活动对信息存储和检索的特定需求而形成的。因此，讨论长期工作记忆时，必须将其放在特定的技能活动背景中。为了解释这一点，我们首先探讨认知过程的基本框架。

我们可以将认知过程视作一连串的状态或思维活动。记忆在这些状态序列中扮演了一座桥梁的角色，连接着不同的认知状态。这些状态是互相依存的，由记忆及环境因素共同塑造这种依存关系。

记忆还有另一个需要特别区分的作用。认知状态 —— 即思维活动 —— 实际上是复杂生成过程的终点产物。通常，这一过程涉及感知、感觉及概念操作等多个层面的知识激活和深化。为了让高层次的过程能够利用低层次过程的成果，这些成果需要在一段时间内保持可访问。这通过一些特定的记忆缓冲区实现，它们在有限的时间内保存着形成最终认知状态的中间过程结果。我们需要把这些存储中间成果的缓冲区与记忆作为连接连续认知状态的中介角色区别开来。

Figure 5 illustrates our conception of the dual role of memory. For each cognitive state,there are complex generation processes ât various levels of analysis, ranging from the sensory to the perceptual to the conceptual. The end products of these processes are the cognitive states that succeed each other over time: the varying contents of STM, the changing focus of attention, the flow of conscious experience. The arrow in Figure 5, which points to these end states, represents the complex, not necessarily linear sequence of processes involved in the generation of a cognitive state, including the necessary memory buffers for the temporary storage of intermediate processing results. These processes depend on the state of the environment as well as on long-term memory factors, namely the individual's experience and knowledge. Conversely, once a cognitive state has been generated, actions may occur that affect the environment, and traces of the present cognitive state may be retained in LTM, as indicated in Figure 5. Thus, to fully explain the succession of cognitive states, one would need to know (1) the state of the environment and its effects on the individual, (2) the individual's knowledge, experience, and beliefs, and how they interact with environmental effects, and(3)the previous cognitive state. According to this hypothesis, one would not need to know how this previous cognitive state was generated or the results of intermediate analyses. Thus, we assume that for the study of cognition the impact of neural activity can be summarized by a limited number of generated results or products.

Insert Figure 5 about here

This view of memory is not without precedents. Ever since Aristotle, complex cognitive activities such as thinking have been described as a sequence of thoughts. More specifically, Newell and Simon(1972) proposed that the contents of STM were sufficient to characterize the sequence of mental states corresponding to cognitive processes. Recently, Anderson (1987a)argued for the distinction of macro and micro processes, macro processes roughly corresponding to those processes that generate stable products affecting the sequence of the thought process. In his model of text comprehension, Kintsch (1988) proposed that successful text comprehension can be described as a sequence of states mediated by cycles of construction and integration of segments of the text.

如图 5 所示，我们理解记忆具有双重角色。每个认知状态背后，都隐藏着从感官、感知到概念各个层面的复杂生成过程。这些过程最终形成了一系列随时间演变的认知状态：短期记忆（STM）内容的变化、注意力焦点的转移、以及意识流动。图 5 中指向这些最终状态的箭头象征了涉及到认知状态生成的复杂过程，这不一定是线性的，包括了为了暂时保存中间处理结果而必须的记忆缓冲区。这些过程既受到环境状态的影响，也依赖于长期记忆中个人的经验和知识。从另一个角度来看，一旦形成了认知状态，就可能采取某些行动来改变环境，同时当前认知状态的某些信息可能被存储进长期记忆（LTM），正如图 5 所指出的。因此，要完整解释认知状态如何一环扣一环，我们需要了解环境状态及其对个体的影响，个人的知识、经验和信仰及其与环境效应的交互作用，以及先前的认知状态。按照这个理论，我们无需详细了解先前认知状态的生成方式或中间分析的具体结果。所以，我们认为，在研究认知过程时，神经活动的影响可以通过有限的成果或产物来概括。

这样的记忆观并非无先例。自亚里士多德以来，如思考等复杂认知活动就被看作是一连串思维的过程。更具体地，Newell 和 Simon（1972 年）认为，短期记忆（STM）的内容足以刻画认知过程中心理状态的序列。近期，Anderson（1987 年）提出了宏观过程与微观过程的区别，其中宏观过程大体上涵盖了那些产生稳定成果、影响思维序列的过程。在 Kintsch（1988 年）的文本理解模型中，他认为，成功理解文本可被看作是通过文本片段构建和整合的循环过程所中介的状态序列。

Although the characterization of cognitive processes as a sequence of states is generally accepted, there is much more controversy over how the relevant information and intermediate products of a state are kept accessible. The modal view of working memory is that all of the relevant information is kept temporarily activated. Our account of LT-WM proposes that in skilled activities a significant part of the accessible information is stored in LTM and is accessible through retrieval cues in STM. It is very difficult to discriminate between these two accounts by mere observation of normal skilled processing. The two accounts could be differentiated, however, if the cognitive processes were interrupted at a given state and the subjects' attention were suddenly diverted toward another demanding, unrelated activity for some time until the former cognitive activity could be resumed again. If the interruption had a sufficiently long duration, the activated information in ST-WM would be irretrievably lost and the interrupted activity could not be continued. Information in LT-WM, on the other hand, would only become inaccessible and could be subsequently retrieved. If the significant information were stored in LT-WM, reactivation of the associated retrieval cues in STM would allow subjects to resume their cognitive process after the interruption. Hence designed interruption is an effective experimental technique to differentiate between storage in ST-WM and storage in LT-WM.

Successful experimental intervention in and disruption of cognitive processes require that the sequence of states in the normal cognitive process be well known and predictable as well as easily monitored. This is not the case for most cognitive processes studied in the laboratory. Typically subjects are given a task requiring the production of an answer, but the sequences of states for achieving this goal can vary greatly among subjects. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine the intermediate states in a given subject's cognitive process, which makes systematic intervention in and disruption of the process difficult if not impossible. There are, however, other types of tasks for which the sequence of intermediate states is better understood and controllable by external factors.

The task of comprehending a text is particularly well suited to the analysis proposed here. While reading a well-written text on a familiar topic, all skilled subjects read the text in more or less the same smooth and linear fashion. The sentences and phrases constitute natural boundaries of segments for processing. Even the words within a phrase are scanned in a linear, orderly fashion,a phenomenon which allows the study of the cognitive processes operating within segments. For all individuals who read, successful comprehension of a text involves the same predictable integration of information for sentences. Hence, as a first approximation, we can argue that comprehension of a text involves roughly the same sequence of states and segments for all skilled readers. In direct contrast, cognitive processes in most other skilled activities are constrained only by the act of successfully completing the task, and the intermediate steps and states may differ considerably across individuals.

虽然认知过程通常被认为是一系列状态的连续，但如何保持状态的相关信息和中间产物的可访问性，这个问题仍然存在许多争议。工作记忆的普遍观点是，所有相关信息都处于临时激活状态。而我们对长期工作记忆（LT-WM）的看法则认为，在技能活动中，很大一部分可访问信息是储存在长期记忆（LTM）中，并通过短期记忆（STM）中的线索来检索的。仅凭观察正常的技能处理过程很难分辨这两种看法。但是，如果我们在特定状态中断认知过程，并突然让参与者转向另一个需要集中注意力的、不相关的活动，等到可以恢复之前的认知活动时，这两种理论就有了区分的可能。如果中断持续足够长的时间，ST-WM 中被激活的信息将无法恢复，而被中断的活动也无法继续。与此相对，LT-WM 中的信息虽然暂时无法访问，但之后可被检索。如果关键信息存储在 LT-WM 中，重新激活 STM 中的检索线索就能让参与者在中断后继续他们的认知过程。因此，通过设计中断作为一种实验手段，我们能够区分信息是存储在 ST-WM 还是 LT-WM 中。

要成功干预并中断认知过程，就必须清楚并能预测正常认知过程中的状态序列，同时这一序列还要容易监控。但在实验室研究的大多数认知过程中，并非如此。通常，参与者需要完成一个任务并给出答案，但达成目标的过程在不同人之间可能大相径庭。此外，确定参与者认知过程中的中间状态往往很困难，这使得系统地干预和中断过程变得非常棘手，有时甚至不可能。不过，有些任务的中间状态序列更容易理解，也可以通过外部因素来控制。

特别是，文本理解任务非常适合我们这里提出的分析方法。在阅读关于熟悉话题的优质文本时，所有经验丰富的读者都会以差不多相同的流畅和线性方式进行阅读。句子和短语自然界定了处理的边界。即便是短语内的单词也按照线性、有序的方式进行扫描，这种现象让我们可以研究段落内的认知过程。对于所有阅读者来说，成功的文本理解都涉及到对句子信息的同样方式的整合。因此，我们可以大致认为，对于所有熟练的读者来说，文本理解涉及相同的状态和段落序列。相比之下，大多数其他技能活动中的认知过程的约束仅来自于成功完成任务的要求，而中间的步骤和状态在不同个体间可能差异很大。

### 04. Text Comprehension

Most educated adults have acquired high levels of skill in the reading and comprehension of texts. Hence text comprehension is far more common skill than the types of expert performance discussed earlier. Any findings about the structure of working memory during text comprehension could therefore be generalized more directly to the general population.

The goal of reading a text is typically to understand or comprehend it. When subjects have finished reading it is possible to assess successful comprehension by asking them questions about the text or by having them summarize the information presented in the text. Once they have understood a test, subjects have substantial memory of the important aspects of the text even when the retention tests are delayed, a finding that indicates storage in LTM.

In the following review of text comprehension, first we examine the representation of text individuals construct and store in LTM. We then discuss the on-line processes during reading that produce this representation, describing the processes by which individual text segments are encoded and then explaining how the constructed representation of the previously read text is kept accessible in working memory so that the information can be encoded and successfully integrated with information presented earlier. We conclude the review by discussing the construction-integration model of text comprehension in order to provide a detailed example of the kind of retrieval structures we claim are the basis of LT-WM.

绝大多数接受过教育的成年人通常具备较高的文本阅读和理解能力。因此，相较于之前讨论的专家级表现，文本理解是一种更为普遍的技能。这意味着，关于文本理解中工作记忆结构的研究成果，可以更直接地对普罗大众产生影响。

通常情况下，我们阅读文本的目的是为了理解或掌握其内容。完成阅读任务后，我们可以通过提问或要求总结文本内容的方式来评估阅读理解是否成功。一旦理解了某个文本，即便是在经过一段时间的延迟测试之后，参与者也能对文本的关键内容记忆犹新，这表明这部分信息被储存在了长期记忆（LTM）中。

在接下来对文本理解的探讨中，我们首先将审视个人如何构建并在长期记忆中保存文本的表征。接着，我们将分析阅读过程中发生的实时认知活动，这些活动怎样产生上述表征，具体描述了如何对文本的各个部分进行编码，并阐释了如何在工作记忆中维持对之前阅读文本的表征的可获取性，以便能将新信息与之前的信息成功融合。我们的讨论将以文本理解的构建-整合模型作为结束，通过这一模型提供一个详尽的例子，展示我们认为构成长期工作记忆（LT-WM）基础的检索结构。

### 05. Memory after Completed Text Comprehension

There are several reasons for evaluating hypotheses about LT-WM by analyzing the memory individual s have for text after they have finished reading and comprehending it. Individuals' substantial memory for text reveals that storage in LTM during text comprehension not only is possible but also occurs as part of normal comprehension. A somewhat stronger connection between text comprehension and subsequent memory for ideas in the text is suggested by experimental manipulations of the degree of perceived comprehension, which is closely related to subsequent recall (Bransford Johnson, 1973). In agreement with other investigators such as Gernsbacher(1990), we propose that a memory representation of the text is constructed during reading and stored in LTM. Furthermore we assume that the relevant parts of this representation remain accessible through cues in STM and thus form the basis for LT-WM during text comprehension.

The psycholinguistic literature has widely used a distinction, derived from linguistics, between three aspects of language: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Comprehension of a sentence is thought to start with a syntactic analysis, followed by a semantic interpretation, and possibly some pragmatic elaborations. According to this view, the end product of reading would be characterized at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic level. It has not been possible, however, to cleanly separate these processes in comprehension. We therefore doubt that this is a useful approach for analyzing the psychological process of comprehension, although we do not question its use in linguistic analysis. We prefer another distinction that is based more directly on the nature of the processes involved in discourse comprehension(Hormann, 1976; van Dijk Kintsch, 1983).

研究人员之所以通过分析人们在完成阅读和理解之后对文本的记忆来评估有关长期工作记忆（LT-WM）的假设，原因有几个。首先，人们对文本的深刻记忆表明，在理解文本时信息能够并且确实会被存储在长期记忆（LTM）中，这是理解过程的一个正常部分。更进一步的是，通过实验改变人们对文本理解程度的感知，研究发现这种感知程度与他们之后对文本中观点的记忆之间有着更紧密的联系。这与 1973 年 Bransford 和 Johnson 的研究发现一致。我们同意 Gernsbacher 在 1990 年的观点，即在阅读过程中会构建文本的记忆表征，并将其存储在长期记忆中。我们还假设，这些记忆表征的关键部分通过短期记忆中的提示可以被访问，因此构成了在文本理解过程中长期工作记忆的基础。

在心理语言学领域，一个广泛采用的概念区分了语言的三个方面：句法（语法结构）、语义（意义）和语用（使用情境）。人们普遍认为，理解一个句子首先进行句法分析，然后是语义解释，最后可能还会有一些基于语境的推敲。这意味着，阅读的最终成果应在句法、语义和语用层面上有所体现。然而，实际上这些过程在理解中很难被完全区分开来。因此，我们对这种方法作为分析理解心理过程的有效性表示怀疑，尽管我们认可它在语言学分析中的应用。相对于此，我们更倾向于另一种分类，这种分类更直接地基于话语理解过程的本质，如 Hormann 于 1976 年，以及 van Dijk 和 Kintsch 在 1983 年的研究所提出。

Different mental representations result from the linguistic processing of the language of a text, the understanding of the text as a separate mental object, and the integration of the textual information and background knowledge. It is useful to distinguish three different levels of representation:

1. Linguistic surface structure. This component of the memory representation of a text comprises the traces of the words of a text, not only by themselves but syntactically, semantically, and pragmatically interpreted in the context of a sentence.

2. Propositional textbase. The textbase is a coherent conceptual representation of a text and its structure. It contains both a microstructure and a macrostructure. Micropropositions are usually directly derived from the text (they correspond to phrases and sentences), or they may be the result of inferential processes(e.g., to bridge a gap in the coherence of a text). The macrostructure results from selection and generalization processes operating on the micropropositions. Macropropositions are thus partly cued directly by the text, and partly inferred.

3. Situation model. The modél of the situation described by the text integrates textual information and background knowledge. This representation is not strictly propositional; it may be a spatial model such as a map. The situation model provides the reader with a basis for inference, elaboration, and action. In most cases, because the reader's purpose is to construct a new situation model or to update an already existing one, this model is a major component of the memory trace.

我们的大脑在处理一段文本时会形成不同的心理图像，这些图像包括对文本语言的处理、将文本作为一个单独的心理实体理解，以及将文本信息与我们的背景知识结合起来。我们可以将这些心理图像分为三个层次：

1、语言表面结构。这是我们对文本记忆中的一个层面，包括我们对文本中每个词语的记忆，不仅仅是词语本身，还包括它们在句子中的语法、含义和用法。

2、命题文本基础。这一层面是对文本及其结构的整体概念理解。它既有细节层面（如直接从文本中得到的短语和句子），也有大局层面。大局视角是通过筛选和概括细节信息而形成的，因此，它既包括文本直接提供的信息，也包括通过推理得到的信息。

3、情境模型。这个模型融合了文本信息和我们的背景知识，构建了一个描述文本所述情境的图像。这种表征并不仅仅是文字的逐字解释，它可能像地图一样，给我们提供了一个空间的视图。情境模型帮助我们进行推理、详细理解和采取行动。因为读者通常是在尝试构建一个新的情境模型或更新一个已有的模型，所以这种模型是我们记忆中一个非常重要的部分。

Researchers concerned with memory for text have focused on different levels of representation. In general, parsimony has dictated that accounts based only on the surface structure be simpler than accounts requiring memory for the propositional textbase and situational models. Glanzer, Dorfman, and Kaplan (1981) claimed that it was sufficient to consider the surface level, at least as far as STM was concerned. Most researchers were unable to accept such a restriction and differentiated at least between a surface level and some sort of semantic representation (Frederiksen, 1975; Kintsch, 1974; Meyer, 1975; Schank, 1972; Schank Abelson, 1977). On the other hand, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that although surface representations are unavailable in many cases, subjects manage to solve experimental tasks very well on the basis of their situation model (Bransford, Barclay, Franks, 1972; Bransford Franks, 1971; Johnson-Laird, 1983).

The division of the representation of text into these three levels is based on the systematic differences in the strength of memory that have been observed among these levels of representation (Fletcher & Chrysler, 1990; Schmalhofer & Glavanov, 1986). If subjects read a text and are later tested with sentences from that text as well as with distracter items, their ability to differentiate between old sentences and meaning-preserving paraphrases provides evidence of surface memory. To the extent that subiects' answers contain more false negatives for a recognition test on paraphrases of sentences which actually appeared in the text than on inferences, subiects can be said to have retained the propositional representation of the text. Finally, an increase in the false negative rate for inferences compared with the rate for contextually related but non-inferable distracter sentences can be considered evidence for a representation at the level of the situational model. Under the conditions of the experiment by Schmalhofer and Glavanov (1986), for instance, the estimated strength of the surface. textbase, and situation model traces were d' = .14, .68, and 1.96, respectively. Subjects in this experiment were reading excerpts from a textbook on the computer language Lisp. The results of this experiment provide clear evidence for the generation of a situational model, as memory for the surface form and the textbase is not sufficiently accurate to account for the observed retention. It must be emphasized, however, that the level of representation subjects prefer strongly depends on the nature of the text they read as well as on their reading goals.

在研究如何记住文本内容时，学者们关注了文本理解的几个不同层面。通常，最简单的理论倾向于只考虑文本的字面意义，而不涉及更深层次的理解，如文本的基本概念和与之相关的情境。1981 年，Glanzer、Dorfman 和 Kaplan 提出，在考虑短期记忆时，只需关注文本的表面层面。然而，大多数研究者不同意这种限制性观点，他们认为至少应该区分文本的字面结构和某种形式的语义表征。

另一方面，研究表明，即使文本的字面表达不总是容易回忆，人们依然能够依据文本所描述的具体情境很好地完成实验任务。这些研究表明，人们不仅记住了文本的字面内容，还形成了关于文本内容的深层理解和具体情境的模型。

通过对文本记忆进行实验，研究人员发现记忆力在这几个层次上有明显的差异。例如，如果让参与者读一篇文章，然后用文章中的句子和一些干扰项进行测试，他们是否能区分原句和改写句提供了对字面记忆的线索。如果参与者在识别改写句的测试中比推断原句的测试出现更多的错误，说明他们记住了文本的基本概念。而如果在与情境相关的推断测试中错误增多，这表明他们构建了一个关于文本情境的模型。

例如，1986 年 Schmalhofer 和 Glavanov 的一个实验让参与者阅读了一段关于计算机语言 Lisp 的教科书摘录。实验结果强有力地表明，参与者通过构建与文本相关的具体情境模型来理解文本，仅仅依靠对字面内容和基本概念的记忆并不能完全解释他们的记忆表现。这也提示我们，在阅读时，我们的大脑不仅仅在处理文字本身，还在积极构建和更新对信息的深层理解和应用。

Although these studies show the usefulness of distinguishing among various levels of representation in text comprehension, they give no justification for reifying these levels. For one study the surface properties of a text may be most interesting: for another, the textbase or the situation model. However, there is no such thing as a surface buffer, nor are there three separate levels of cognition. These are only analytic categories, perspectives we can bring to bear in analyzing texts. In one case we want to emphasize the surface relations among the text units: in another. the semantic or situation model relations. Furthermore, these three levels are not exhaustive. For example, in the study of algebra word problems, it is important to distinguish the algebraic problem model from the naive understanding of a situation (Nathan, Kintsch, & Young, 1992); in human-computer interaction, the distinction between a system model (a task analysis from the standpoint of the system) and the situation model (how the task is understood by the naive user) has proved to be useful (G. Fischer. Henninger, Redmiles, 1991); in analyzing poetic language, the emphasis may be on rhyme, rhythm, and alliterative relations (Kintsch, in press-a). Thus, the levels of representation in text comprehension discussed here are to be understood simply as useful categories for the analysis of comprehension processes.

There are usually differences in the retention of the surface. textbase. and situation model of a text. The surface structure is generally stored until the end of a sentence and may be lost rapidly thereafter. The textbase is stored for the sentence currently being read and can be retrieved thereafter from LTM by means of conceptual retrieval cues. The situation model is often the longest lasting component of the memory trace (e.g., Kintsch, Welsch, Schmalhofer, Zimny. 1990). Although it is generally true that meaning is retained better than surface memory (Bransford franks. 1971: Sachs, 1967; for sign language, Hanson & Bellugi, 1982) long-term retention of surface form is by no means rare (Hjelmquist, 1984; Kintsch & Bates, 1977; Masson, 1984). Indeed, surface form is retained best when the way something is expressed is pragmatically significant and thus relevant to the situation model. It matters a great deal whether a partner in a discourse has said something politely or aggressively, and in these situations the wording is quite well remembered (Bates. Kintsch. Fletcher, 1980; Keenan, MacWhinney, & Mayhew, 1977). Outside of a social context, however, in laboratory studies of memory for sentences, memory is in general propositional, and surface features are typically reconstructed (Potter & Lombardi, 1990).

虽然对文本理解的多层次分析显示了区分这些层次的重要性，但我们并不能因此认为这些层次在认知过程中真实独立存在。在不同的研究中，有时我们可能对文本的直接表述（表面结构）感兴趣，有时可能更关注文本的基本意义（文本基础）或者是文本描述情境的整体理解（情境模型）。然而，这些只是我们用来分析文本的不同视角，而不是指示存在着分隔的认知层次或是某种「表面缓冲区」。

例如，研究代数问题时区分代数模型和初学者的直观理解很重要；在人机交互研究中，系统设计者的任务分析与用户的直观理解之间的区别同样关键；而在诗歌分析中，我们可能会特别关注押韵、节奏和头韵等语言特性。这说明了在分析文本理解过程时，我们讨论的这些层次只是作为有用的分析工具。

实际上，人们对文本的表面形式、文本内容的基础结构和描述的情境有着不同程度的记忆保留。通常，人们在读完一句话后会暂时记住它的字面形式，但这种记忆很快就可能消失。文本的深层内容在阅读时被记忆，并可以在之后通过概念线索从长期记忆中回忆。而对文本描述的情境模型通常能够长时间保留在记忆中。值得一提的是，即便通常情况下人们更容易记住文本的意义而非其表面形式，有时候表面形式的记忆也会因其在特定语境中的重要性而被较好地保存下来。例如，对话中某人的措辞是礼貌还是攻击性的，这种细节在社会互动中往往能被很好地记住。但在实验室环境下，对句子的记忆通常关注于基本的命题内容，而具体的表达形式则往往是事后重建的。

Other types of evidence also imply that skilled readers construct an integrated representation of the text in LTM. After reading a text, subiects are able to answer comprehension questions even when the answers require integration of information presented in different parts of the text (Daneman Carpenter, 1980). Subiects are also able to extract the central message of the text and to provide valid summaries of the texts (Kintsch & Kozminsky, 1977). When instructed to recall a text, subjects are more likely to recall central ideas and propositions that are causally connected to many other propositions in the text (see van den Broek [1990] for a review) and that are at higher levels in the hierarchical structure of the textbase (Kintsch van Dijk, 1978).

In a recent book Gernsbacher (1990) has assembled a wide range of evidence supporting the notion of structure building. She shows that the pattern of subjects' reading times is consistent with building a structure of text because more reading time is required to lay the foundation for a new structure or sub-structure than to continue processing within the current structure. The constructed structure appears to be quite general, since it makes surprisingly little difference whether a story is presented as a regular text or as a sequence of textless cartoons (Baggett, 1975) or as a silent film (Baggett, 1979). Furthermore, text comprehension during reading is highly related to comprehension during listening (see Gernsbacher, 1990, for a review). This invariance over the type and medium of presentation suggest that the essence of comprehension involves situation models.

In sum, the evidence reviewed supports the claim that a structure of the text is constructed in LTM during reading. For this structure to be continually expanded to integrate new information from the text, relevant parts of it must remain accessible during reading. Our main conjecture is that the accessible portions of this structure in LTM serve as an extended working memory (LT-WM). Unlike some related proposals (cf. Gernsbacher, 1990)that assume that accessibility of all information in working memory is based on short-term activation, our proposal distinguishes the short-term activation involved in interpreting text segments from the storage and integration of final encodings in the structure of the text in LTM.

其他的证据也表明，读得好的人在他们的长期记忆中构建了文本的综合性表达。阅读完一段文字后，人们能够回答涉及将文本不同部分的信息综合在一起的理解性问题（Daneman & Carpenter, 1980 年研究）。人们还能够抽取出文本的核心信息，并对文本进行有效的概括（Kintsch & Kozminsky, 1977 年的研究）。当被要求回忆文本时，人们更倾向于记住那些与文本中许多其他部分有因果联系的核心观点，这些观点通常位于文本结构的较高层次（见 van den Broek [1990] 的回顾）。

Gernsbacher 在 1990 年的一本书中汇总了支持结构构建观点的广泛证据。她指出，人们的阅读时间模式符合构建文本结构的过程，即创建一个新的结构或子结构需要比在当前结构内进行处理更多的时间。构建的结构表现出极大的通用性，不管是以常规文本形式，还是通过一系列无文字卡通（Baggett, 1975）或无声电影（Baggett, 1979）呈现，其对理解的影响出奇地小。此外，阅读时的理解与听时的理解之间存在高度的相关性（见 Gernsbacher, 1990 的回顾）。这种对呈现方式和媒介的不变性表明，理解的核心涉及到情境模型的构建。

综上所述，这些研究支持了一个观点：在阅读期间，人们在长期记忆中构建了文本的结构。为了让这个结构能够持续扩展以整合来自文本的新信息，其关键部分必须在阅读过程中保持可访问性。我们的主要假设是，长期记忆中这个结构的可访问部分作为一种扩展的工作记忆（LT-WM）。不同于其他一些提议（参考 Gernsbacher, 1990），这些建议认为工作记忆中所有信息的可访问性是基于短期激活的，我们的观点则区分了解释文本片段时涉及的短期激活与在长期记忆中对文本结构的存储和整合。

### 06. Memory During the Reading of a Text

When subjects read a well-written text, they proceed smoothly from one sentence to the next. We assume that when the processing of an entire clause or sentence is completed, the new information has been successfully integrated into the structure of the previously read text in LTM. When the next sentence is processed, some elements of the current structure of the text are kept in STM to provide context as well as to serve as retrieval cues for the accessible portions of that structure. We make an important distinction in our proposal between the final state corresponding to a completed encoding of a new text segment and the transitory period when the segment is being read and processed. We now consider memory during reading and describe our proposal in more detail. We first discuss the short- term storage of a text segment while it is being processed. Then we consider how elements in the structure of a text can serve as context that allows information to be integrated across the boundaries of text segments.

当参与者阅读一篇条理清晰、写作精良的文章时，他们能够流畅地从一句话过渡到下一句。我们认为，当一整个句子或从句处理完毕后，新的信息就成功地融合到了之前阅读文本的长期记忆（LTM）结构中。在处理接下来的句子时，文本当前结构的某些要素会被保留在短期记忆（STM）中，这既提供了上下文信息，也充当了检索可达结构部分的线索。我们的理论中一个重要的区别在于，我们区分了文本段编码完成的最终状态和文本段正在阅读及处理的过渡期。现在，我们将进一步讨论阅读过程中的记忆问题，并详细描述我们的观点。首先，我们探讨在处理过程中文本段的短期存储问题。然后，我们将探讨文本结构中的元素如何作为一种上下文存在，使得跨文本段边界的信息整合成为可能。

#### Intermediate Representation of Text Segments

The sequence of intermediate representations generated during reading and the associated storage buffers have been explored in great detail (see, for instance, Potter, 1983). First, light receptors register visual information on the retina; then, in a series of transformations, the neural information is further analyzed en route to the associative cortex. Higher levels of representation are derived from the lower level representations as the information at each lower level is maintained briefly in associated memory buffers. One may thus describe the role of memory in the generation of cognitive states, as shown in Figure 5, as a sequence of temporary memory buffers with different characteristics. What is stored in these memory buffers are temporary representations, which are accessible to other cognitive processes only in highly restricted ways. Some low-order buffers can be accessed only by certain specialized processes. Their contents are never consciously experienced, and their existence can be demonstrated only by special experimental methods. The contents of other buffers, on the other hand, may be transferred to the level where conscious experience is possible; but at that point they become contents of working memory, characterized by the same properties as other contents of working memory. Thus, some results of intermediate perceptual and conceptual processing are only temporarily buffered and by their very nature are transitory and unconscious. Others are normally so, but may become cognitive end products in their own right and are thus consciously experienced.

Furthermore, some of these intermediate buffers receive input not only from the sensory, perceptual, and conceptual processes but also from working memory directly. That is, they serve as slave systems for the central executive, as Baddeley (1986) has shown. These are the articulatory loop and the visual-spatial scratch pad, which are capable of recycling special sorts of information under the control of the central executive.

文本段的中间表现形式

在阅读过程中生成的中间表现形式及其相关的存储缓冲区已经得到了深入的研究（参见 Potter, 1983）。首先，光感受器在视网膜上记录下视觉信息；随后，通过一系列变换过程，这些神经信息被进一步分析，直至到达联合皮层。更高级别的表现形式是从较低级别的表现形式中派生出来的，每一个较低级别的信息都会在相应的记忆缓冲区中短暂保持。因此，记忆在生成认知状态过程中的作用，可以被描述为一个具有不同特征的临时记忆缓冲区序列，如图 5 所示。这些记忆缓冲区中存储的是临时表现形式，它们只能在非常有限的范围内被其他认知过程访问。一些低级缓冲区仅能被特定的专门过程访问。它们的内容永远不会被意识到，只有通过特殊的实验方法才能证明它们的存在。而其他缓冲区的内容则可能被转移到可以进行意识体验的层面；但此时，它们就成为了工作记忆的内容，具有与工作记忆中的其他内容相同的特性。因此，一些中间的感知和概念处理结果仅是暂时被缓冲，本质上是过渡性和无意识的。其他的虽然通常也是这样，但它们可能成为自身的认知成果，并因此被有意识地体验。

此外，一些中间缓冲区不仅从感觉、感知和概念过程中获取输入，还能直接从工作记忆中获取输入。这意味着，它们作为中央执行系统的辅助系统，正如 Baddeley（1986）所示。这包括语音回路和视觉 - 空间记事本，它们在中央执行系统的控制下能够循环利用特定类型的信息。

Thus, putting some of the notions of Potter(1983) and Baddeley (1986)together, we arrive at the following sequence of intermediate buffers in reading a text. The neurophysiological bases of the first three buffers including the differentiation between space and pattern information are relatively well understood. The remaining memory buffers with higher levels of representation involve learned recodings of visual stimuli.

1. Retinotopic icon. This buffer is the perceptible continuation of a single presented word resulting from photoreceptors and other neural mechanisms. Apparently, this buffer has no function in normal reading and plays a role only under special laboratory conditions.

2. Spatiotopic visual memory. Retinal information from successive eye-fixations is integrated at this level of processing. The printed text is represented as a stable structure located in space.

3. Reatopic visual memory. Spatial characteristics of the retinal information are less relevant at this level of transformation than are the configuration of visual features and patterns of the perceptually available text segment. Even when this text segment is removed and replaced with an irrelevant stimulus (visual mask), information about the original text segment is retained in this memory buffer for several seconds.

4. Conceptual buffer. At this level of representation, words and objects are perceived and understood. Experimental results show that words can be momentarily understood, but are then lost because of interference from other cognitive processes. Conceptual representations become conscious and receive permanence only when transferred to working memory.

5. The articulatory loop. Even skilled, adult readers transform visual information in reading into an acoustic form (we ignore here the debate whether this level of representation is best understood as acoustic or articulatory-motoric). Articulatory representations not only are intermediate results in the sequence of cognitive processes but also may become contents of working memory; and material from working memory can be recycled in the articulatory loop. Thus, this buffer may function as a slave system for working memory (Baddeley, 1986).

6. The visual-spatial scratch pad. This is Baddeley's (1986) other slave system, which has much the same function in the visual-spatial domain as the articulatory loop in the acoustic domain.

7. Working memory. This is comparable to Baddeley's(1986) central executive. It comprises the entire cognitive work space(here we deviate from Potter, 1983)where information about the current text segment is stored in rapidly accessible form. Information in working memory is the cognitive end product of all the foregoing processes, but is itself complex and structured and involves different levels of representation.

因此，结合了 Potter（1983）和 Baddeley（1986）的理论，我们总结出了阅读文本时所涉及的一系列中间存储缓冲区。前三个缓冲区涉及的是神经生理基础，包括空间信息和图案信息的区别，这部分相对来说理解得比较清楚。而剩下的记忆缓冲区则代表了更高层次的信息处理，主要关注于对视觉刺激的学习性重编码。

1、视网膜映像。这是一个基于光感受器和其他神经机制，能够对单个展示的单词产生感知延续的缓冲区。这个缓冲区在日常阅读中并无实际作用，只在特殊的实验条件下有所作用。

2、空间视觉记忆。这一阶段的处理整合了连续眼动的视网膜信息，将印刷文字表现为一个在空间中稳定存在的结构。

3、配置视觉记忆。在这个处理阶段，与视网膜信息的空间特征相比，视觉特征的配置和可感知文本段的图案更为重要。即便当这段文本被移除并用一个不相关的刺激替换（如视觉掩码），关于原文本段的信息仍能在此记忆缓冲区内保留数秒。

4、概念理解缓冲区。在这一层面，单词和物体被感知并理解。实验结果表明，单词可以被瞬间理解，但随后可能因其他认知过程的干扰而迅速遗忘。只有当概念表达转移到工作记忆中时，它们才会变得有意识并得以保持。

5、语音循环。即便是熟练的成年读者，也会在阅读中将视觉信息转化为声音形式（这里不讨论这种表征是应该更偏向声学还是发音 - 动作的争议）。语音表征不仅仅是认知处理序列中的中间成果，也可能成为工作记忆的内容；工作记忆中的材料可以在语音循环中被重复利用。因此，这个缓冲区可以作为工作记忆的一个辅助系统。

6、视觉-空间草稿板。这是 Baddeley（1986）提出的另一个辅助系统，在视觉 - 空间领域的作用与语音循环在声学领域的作用非常相似。

7、工作记忆。它可以看作是 Baddeley（1986）所说的中央执行系统。它构成了整个认知工作区域（这里我们对 Potter 的定义有所扩展），当前文本段的信息以快速可访问的方式存储在其中。工作记忆中的信息是前面所有过程的认知成果，但它本身是复杂且结构化的，涵盖了不同的表征层次。

Figure 6 (modified from Potter, 1983) illustrates this temporal sequence of buffers. Positron emission tomography (PET) and event-related potential (ERP) studies indicate activity in the right posterior cortex during visual feature analysis (Posner McCandliss, 1993), beginning at about 100 ms. By 200 ms there is activity in the left-lateralized visual word form area if the strings analyzed are word candidates, but not otherwise. The time necessary to encode acoustical information can be estimated as about 175 ms: A reader needs at least 400 ms to pronounce a word, 225 of which appear to be needed for articulation (if a subject knows which word is to be pronounced, the time to articulate it is 225 ms). Conceptual processing begins about 100 ms after the fixation of a word. At 250 ms, PET and ERP results show diffuse activation in frontal brain regions of both hemispheres. Priming studies (e.g., Swinney, 1979) indicate that it takes about 350 ms for the meaning of a word to be fixated in context. PET studies indicate that if subjects are given enough time, the activity associated with semantic processing shifts from the frontal regions to posterior regions(Posner McCandliss, 1993).

图 6（基于 Potter, 1983 的修改）展示了阅读过程中涉及的缓冲区的时间序列。正电子发射断层扫描（PET）和事件相关电位（ERP）的研究揭示，当进行视觉特征分析时，右侧后皮层会在大约 100 毫秒时开始活动（Posner McCandliss, 1993）。到了 200 毫秒，如果分析的字符串是可能的单词，则左侧的视觉单词形态区域会活跃起来，否则不会。估计编码声学信息需要大约 175 毫秒：一个读者至少需要 400 毫秒来发音一个单词，其中约 225 毫秒用于发音本身（如果读者知道将要发音的是哪个单词，那么发音需要的时间是 225 毫秒）。概念处理在单词被注视后约 100 毫秒开始。到了 250 毫秒，PET 和 ERP 的结果显示大脑两个半球的前部区域出现弥散性激活。启动研究显示（例如，Swinney, 1979），单词的含义在上下文中固定大约需要 350 毫秒。PET 研究指出，如果给予受试者充足的时间，与语义处理相关的活动会从前部区域转移到后部区域（Posner McCandliss, 1993）。

Working Memory 

The sequence of buffers outlined in Figure 6 is critical to the integration and comprehension of segments of text (cf. Figure 5), such as phrases and sentences. Deficits in any one of these storage buffers may have complex results beyond the buffer in question. Thus, phonological storage deficits affect not only the acoustic buffer itself but also general learning and comprehension capacities. Baddeley et al. (1988) observed a patient with such a deficit and found a normal ability to associate meaningful, familiar word pairs, but an almost total inability to associate words with unfamiliar sounds (words in another language). Apparently, the patient could process familiar sound patterns adequately, without having to maintain them in the acoustic buffer. But the patient did not have enough time to analyze unfamiliar sound patterns without maintaining them at least briefly in the acoustic buffer. Baddeley and Wilson(1988) observed a similar patient who had no trouble identifying single words and comprehending brief sentences, even syntactically complex ones. This patient, however, could not understand longer sentences because, although comprehension abilities were intact, the patient could not maintain speech sounds long enough in the acoustic store to complete a successful analysis. Analysis was unsuccessful, for instance, when an early word in a sentence could not be disambiguated until late in the sentence.

Although Figure 6 represents our best guess at this time, we are not strongly committed to this particular sequence of buffers and their time course, or to the way the arrows between these buffers have been drawn. Further research will change some of this detail; the important point for us concerns the existence of some such sequence of intermediate buffers and their relation to working memory. It is, of course, a highly significant research question to come up with a more accurate version of Figure 6-but it is not our question. We merely want to raise this issue and show how it relates to the study of working memory proper. We can now refer to what Baddeley has called the central executive without having provided definitive answers to the many questions about intermediate memory buffers, but having shown, at least, how this aspect of human memory fits in with our view of working memory.

如图6所示的缓冲区序列对于文本段落的整合和理解至关重要，比如短语和句子。任何一个缓冲区的缺失都可能导致超出该缓冲区范围的复杂问题。因此，语音存储的缺陷不仅影响声学缓冲本身，还会影响到一般的学习和理解能力。Baddeley等人（1988）观察了一个有这种缺陷的病人，发现他能正常地将有意义、熟悉的单词对联系起来，但几乎完全无法将单词与不熟悉的声音（例如，另一种语言中的单词）联系起来。显然，这位病人能够充分处理熟悉的声音模式，而无需长时间保持在声学缓冲中。但是，病人在没有至少短暂保持在声学缓冲中的情况下，无法分析不熟悉的声音模式。Baddeley和Wilson（1988）观察到一个类似的病例，该病人能够识别单个单词并理解简短的句子，即便是结构复杂的句子。然而，这位病人无法理解较长的句子，因为尽管他的理解能力没有受损，但无法在声学存储中保持语音声音足够长的时间来完成有效的分析。比如，当一个句子中早期的单词直到句子末尾才能被明确其意义时，分析就失败了。

虽然图6代表了我们目前的最佳推测，但我们并不完全确定这一特定的缓冲区序列及其时间进程，或者这些缓冲区之间的连接方式。未来的研究将会修改这些细节；对我们来说，重要的是这样一系列中间缓冲区的存在及其与工作记忆的关系。当然，提出图6更精确的版本是一个非常重要的研究课题——但这不是我们的重点。我们想提出这个议题，并展示它如何与工作记忆的研究相关联。我们现在可以提及Baddeley所称的中央执行系统，尽管我们并未对关于中间记忆缓冲区的众多问题提供确定的答案，但至少我们展示了这部分人类记忆是如何与我们对工作记忆的理解相吻合的。

#### The Time Course of the Construction of Mental Representation of Text Segments

It is necessary not only to distinguish different levels of representation in the cognitive states that arise in reading but also to be aware that the time to generate these different end products may vary. As shown in Figure 6, it takes about 350 ms for a word to be made available in working memory. At this point the word has been acoustically coded and identified semantically. Other processes involved in text comprehension, such as the generation of a situation model, may take considerably longer, however. An experimental study by Till, Mross, and Kintsch(1988)illustrates this fact. This study explored the relationship between a homonymic priming word embedded in a disambiguating sentence and target words that are associates either to the context-relevant meaning of the homonym (e.g., the priming word was "mint" used in the sense of "building," and the target "money")or the context-inappropriate meaning (e.g., the target "candy"). The results are shown in Figure 7, in which the difference in the reaction time between unrelated and related target words is plotted as a function of the prime-target asynchrony. For the first 350 ms after the prime word was presented, reaction times to related and unrelated target words did not differ; but after that time, reaction times for related target words were consistently faster.

These data replicate the results of Swinney (1979), Gernsbacher, Varner and Faust (1990), and others. They imply that context does not work like a filter that facilitates the expected or inhibits the unexpected. Rather, the construction of meaning in a discourse takes time and requires the integration of the target word and its context.

Insert Figure 7 about here

It takes considerably more time, however, to construct a situation model than to disambiguate a word. For the simple sentences used in the Till et al. study, the construction of a situation model amounted essentially to inferring the sentence topic. Apparently, this inference was not completed until 1 s after the end of the sentence. Given the sentence "The townspeople were surprised that all buildings had collapsed except the mint, subjects could not identify "earthquake", which was in the sentence topic as determined by a prior rating study, as a word more rapidly than they could identify thematically irrelevant control words when the words were presented 200-500 ms after the end of the sentence, even though it would have been possible for subjects to have inferred the sentence topic earlier while reading the sentence. As Figure 7 shows, only after 1 s could a priming effect be observed. From this result we conclude that 1 s was needed to infer the sentence topic for isolated sentences. Word meanings are formed quickly; discourse meaning, in this case, took about 1 s to be constructed. 

在阅读过程中，我们不仅要区分认知状态中的不同层面，还要明白，形成这些不同的理解结果可能需要不同的时间。例如，如图 6 所示，一个单词进入我们的工作记忆需要大约 350 毫秒。这时，单词已经通过声音被编码，并且在意义上被识别了。但是，理解文本涉及的其他过程，比如构建对情境的理解，可能需要更长的时间。Till、Mross 和 Kintsch 在 1988 年的一项实验研究就展示了这一点。该研究探索了在特定语境下使用的同音异义词对目标词理解的影响，比如启动词「铸币厂（mint）」在「建筑」意义上的使用与目标词「金钱（money）」的关系，或者与不相关语境的意义（如「糖果（candy）」）的关系。结果表明，在启动词呈现后的最初 350 毫秒内，与相关和不相关的目标词的反应时间无差异；但过了这段时间后，与相关目标词的反应时间显著加快。

这一发现与 Swinney（1979 年）、Gernsbacher、Varner 和 Faust（1990 年）等人的研究结果一致。这表明，在理解过程中，语境并不像一个简单地筛选预期信息或阻挡意外信息的过滤器。相反，理解一段话语的含义需要时间，因为它要求将目标词与其所处的语境整合起来。

然而，比起单词的消歧义，构建一个完整的情境理解需要更多的时间。以 Till 等人的研究为例，简单句子中情境理解的构建，实际上是推理出句子的主题。显然，这种推理直到句子结束后的 1 秒才完成。例如，对于句子「镇上的人们对除了铸币厂外所有建筑都倒塌感到惊讶」，即使读者在阅读过程中可能已经早早推断出句子的主题，但在句子结束后 200-500 毫秒内呈现的单词中，读者无法比他们识别与主题无关的控制词更快地识别出「地震」这一关键词。只有在 1 秒后，启动效应才变得明显。因此，我们可以得出结论，对于单独的句子，完成句子主题的推断需要大约 1 秒的时间。单词的意义很快就形成了，但在这种情况下，理解整个话语的含义则需要大约 1 秒的时间。

A similar emergence over time for the encoded structure of sentences has been documented by Gernsbacher (1990). When two participants are mentioned in a sentence, there is an immediate access advantage for the most recently mentioned participant, but over time (1-2 s later) the advantage is reversed and the first-mentioned participant is more accessible. According to Gernsbacher's (1990; also Kintsch & Welsch, 1991) conception of text comprehension as structure building, the first- mentioned participant is part of the structural foundation to which subsequently mentioned information is related. Subsequent retrieval, once the transient activation has subsided, is mediated by the constructed structure, which gives the first-mentioned participant an access advantage.

Converging evidence for the time course we propose for construction of mental representations in reading comes from studies with PET and ERP methods that are reviewed by Posner McCandliss (1993). These authors point out that visual feature and word-form processing appear to be entirely bottom-up and occur without previous activation in phonological or semantic areas. At about 250 ms, there is very diffuse activity in frontal brain regions critical for semantic processing. Presumably, this activity corresponds to the initial activation of various possible semantic codes associated with the visual word form that has been determined by that time. Later, semantic activity shifts to posterior areas(Wernicke's area)and becomes hemisphere specific: Whereas the diffuse activity persists in the right hemisphere, all but the most common associates are suppressed in the left hemisphere. Presumably, this ongoing activity corresponds to the contextual fixation of word meanings- that is, the suppression of context-irrelevant information and the construction of an elaborated discourse meaning, such as the formation of topical inferences.

Gernsbacher 在 1990 年的研究发现，句子结构的理解也会随着时间逐渐显现。当一个句子提及两个参与者时，最近被提及的参与者会立刻更容易被理解和记忆，但随着时间（1-2 秒后）推移，这种情况会逆转，首先被提及的参与者变得更容易被获取。根据 Gernsbacher 的理论（也由 Kintsch 和 Welsch 在 1991 年进一步探讨），文本理解可以被视为是一个结构构建的过程，其中首先提及的参与者构成了理解结构的基础，随后提及的信息与之建立关联。一旦最初的注意力消退，后续的信息检索就依赖于这个已构建的结构，这让首先提及的参与者在获取上拥有了优势。

我们关于阅读中心智表征构建的时间进程的理论得到了来自使用正电子发射断层扫描（PET）和事件相关电位（ERP）方法的研究的支持，这些研究被 Posner McCandliss 在 1993 年进行了回顾。这些研究指出，视觉特征和词形的处理完全是自下而上进行的，即在没有语音或语义激活的情况下发生。在大约 250 毫秒时，前脑区域 —— 对语义处理至关重要的区域 —— 会出现非常分散的活动。这可能对应于对视觉词形相关的各种可能语义编码的初始激活。随后，语义活动转移到大脑的后部区域（Wernicke 区），并变得特定于半球：尽管右半球的活动持续存在，左半球则抑制了除最常见的关联以外的所有信息。这一持续的活动可能对应于词义在上下文中的确定 —— 也就是说，抑制了与上下文无关的信息，并构建了一个更为详细的话语意义，比如形成关于主题的推断。

In general, readers attempt to interpret whatever structure they encounter -lexical, syntactic, semantic, or discourse- immediately rather than engaging in a wait-and-see strategy(for a detailed review, see Just Carpenter, 1987.)However, this means only that they begin the interpretive process as soon as possible. It is not necessarily the case that each word is fully encoded while it is being fixated. A fixation lasts around 200-250 ms (See Footnote 1), whereas word meanings in a discourse context need around 350 ms to stabilize. It has long been recognized in the case of syntactic analysis and text level processing that while these processes start immediately, they may take a considerable amount of time, in part because the required information is provided only at a later time in a sentence or a discourse (Aaronson & Scarborough, 1976; Baddeley & Wilson, 1988; Just & Carpenter, 1987). The same is true, however, for the encoding of word meanings, which also may take longer than the time it takes to fixate the word (even though the eye movement data reported by Just and Carpenter provide no support for this claim).

We have argued that it is necessary to differentiate the function of memory in the process of generating cognitive states from its function in relating different states. In the former case, memory buffers contain intermediate results, which are significant for the formation of the cognitive state, but irrelevant once it has been formed. In the other case we are talking about the storage and retrieval of cognitive end products. Focusing on reading, we have specified the buffer sequence that is necessary for the retention of intermediate results. Further, we have emphasized that the cognitive state that is the end product of reading, is complex and must be characterized at different levels of representation, and that different time parameters are associated with the generation of these different levels. These lengthy arguments were necessary because if we want to talk about retrieval and storage of cognitive end products in a complex process such as reading and to differentiate these processes from the buffering of intermediate results, we must clearly and adequately characterize the cognitive states that are achieved in reading. For instance, the findings that readers remember the surface features of a text does not necessarily mean that they remember intermediate results. Surface features can be a component of a final cognitive state just as well as other aspects of the text.

一般来说，读者在遇到任何结构 —— 无论是词汇、句法、语义还是话语结构 —— 时都会尝试立即进行解释，而不是采取先等待再看的策略（详细分析可参考 Just Carpenter, 1987 年的研究）。这实际上意味着，他们会尽可能早地开始解读过程。但这并不意味着每个单词在注视时都会被完全理解。注视一个单词的时间大约是 200-250 毫秒（参见脚注 1），而在话语语境中理解单词的含义则需要大约 350 毫秒才能稳定下来。长久以来的研究已经表明，在句法分析和文本级处理方面，尽管这些过程会立即开始，但它们可能需要更长的时间来完成，部分原因是所需的信息直到句子或话语的后半部才会出现（参考 Aaronson & Scarborough, 1976; Baddeley & Wilson, 1988; Just & Carpenter, 1987 的研究）。单词含义的理解也是如此，它可能需要的时间比单词的注视时间更长（尽管 Just 和 Carpenter 的眼动研究并没有支持这一点）。

我们认为，有必要区分记忆在生成认知状态过程中的作用与其在关联不同状态中的作用。在前者的情况下，记忆缓冲区包含了对形成认知状态至关重要的中间结果，但一旦状态形成，这些结果就不再重要了。而在后者的情况中，我们讨论的是认知最终产物的存储和提取。专注于阅读过程，我们指出了保留中间结果所需的缓冲序列。此外，我们还强调了阅读的最终产物 —— 即认知状态是复杂的，需要在不同的层次上加以描述，而且生成这些不同层次的时间参数也是各不相同的。进行这些详细的论述是必要的，因为如果我们想要讨论如阅读这样复杂过程中认知最终产物的存储与提取，并将其与中间结果的缓冲区分开，我们就必须清晰并充分地描述阅读过程中实现的认知状态。例如，研究发现读者记得文本的表层特征，并不一定意味着他们记得了中间结果。表层特征同文本的其他方面一样，也可以是最终认知状态的一个组成部分。

#### Working Memory Across Boundaries of Text Segments

We now consider how the end products encoded in the structure of the text can remain accessible while subsequent segments of the text are processed. The central characteristic of text comprehension is the integration of successive sentences of a text into a coherent representation. Information about text previously read must be kept accessible in working memory if the sentence currently being read is to be successfully integrated. Numerous questions can be posed about the amount and type of information that must be maintained in an activated state in STM-WM and kept accessible in LTM-WM during text comprehension. Here a formidable methodological problem arises. Long-Term Working Memory 22

According to the prevailing view, working memory in text comprehension is based only on transient activation of information. The prediction following from this view is that a disruption of reading and engagement in an unrelated, attention-demanding activity should lead to an irretrievable loss of the information in ST-WM necessary for continued text comprehension. When reading is resumed at a later point, comprehension of the following text should be greatly impaired. It is virtually impossible, however, to study the accessibility of information in working memory during text comprêhension without some kind of additional testing or other type of disruption of the normal continuous reading process.

If, on the other hand our proposal for LT-WM is correct, this methodological problem dissolves. The prediction that follows from our proposal is the opposite of the art that follows from the prevailing view: Disruption of text comprehension should not cause irreparable harm and can be corrected by retrieval of thê necessary structures from LTM and by reactivation of the corresponding retrieval cues in STM. If so, a broader range of techniques can be used to study working memory. In this section, after reviewing disruptions, we consider studies that have examined access and activation of information in working memory.

我们接下来考虑，当处理文本的后续部分时，如何使文本结构中编码的最终产品保持易于获取。理解文本的核心在于将一系列句子融合为一个连贯的整体。要想顺利地将当前阅读的句子融入之前的理解中，就必须保持先前阅读过的信息在工作记忆中的可获取状态。关于在文本理解过程中，需要在短期-工作记忆（STM-WM）中保持哪些信息的激活状态，以及需要在长期 - 工作记忆（LTM-WM）中保持哪些信息可获取，存在诸多疑问。这里，我们面临着一个巨大的方法论挑战。

根据普遍的观点，文本理解中的工作记忆仅基于信息的瞬间激活。根据这一观点，阅读的中断以及参与一项无关的、需要集中注意力的活动，会导致短期工作记忆中对续续文本理解必需的信息不可恢复地丢失。当阅读在后面某个时刻恢复时，对接下来文本的理解可能会受到严重影响。然而，要在不通过某种形式的额外测试或对正常阅读过程的其他类型干扰的情况下研究文本理解中工作记忆信息的可访问性，几乎是不可能的。

如果我们对长期工作记忆（LT-WM）的看法是正确的，那么这个方法论上的问题就不复存在了。我们的观点预测了一个与普遍观点完全相反的情况：文本理解的中断不应该造成不可修复的伤害，而是可以通过从长期记忆中检索必要的结构和在短期记忆中重新激活相应的检索线索来得到修正。如果确实如此，那么我们就能使用更广泛的技术来研究工作记忆了。在本节中，我们在回顾了阅读中断的影响之后，将探讨一些研究，这些研究检查了工作记忆中信息的获取和激活情况。

The effects of disrupted reading on text comprehension. In a long series of experiments Glanzer and his colleagues (B. Fischer Glanzer, 1986; Glanzeret al., 1981; Glanzer, B. Fischer, Dorfman, 1984)have interrupted sentence-by-sentence reading of texts with an unrelated activity and then allowed reading of the text to resume. When Glanzer and his colleagues compared interrupted reading to a normal control condition, they found a very consistent general pattern of results across different experiments with different types of interrupting activities. Most important, disruptions of text comprehension did not reliably influence either the speed or the accuracy of answers to comprehension questions. The effect of the disruption was limited to an increase in the reading time for the first sentence after reading was resumed. These two findings imply that information in working memory was not irreparably lost during the interruption. By retrieval of the appropriate elements in the structure of the text from LTM, it should be possible to reinstate the context and the accessibility of information relevant to continued comprehension.

The ease and speed with which critical elements are retrieved after the interruption should be influenced by the interpolated activity. Because the increased reading time after the interruption should reflect these retrieval times, we examine the increased reading times as a function of the type and duration of the unrelated activity during the interruption.

In the first experiment Glanzer et al. (1981, Exp. 2a)compared continuous reading to an interruption involving the solution of three short addition problems and found an increase in the reading time of 450 ms. The reading time for the three-problem intervention was longer by 250 ms that for the one-problem intervention. Although the duration of the interruptions was not recorded, it can be estimated to be less than 10 s even for the three-problem intervention. In later studies the duration of the interpolated activity was extended to around 30 s. B. Fischer and Glanzer (1986, Exp. 2)used two trials of a digit recall task, which lasted an average of 31 s, as the interpolated activity and with this activity B. Fischer and Glanzer obtained an increased reading time of around 1200 ms for resumed reading. In two other experiments (Exp. 3 and 4)they had subjects verify additions for around 30 s and obtained an increased reading time of around 1800 ms. Both the duration and particular type of intervening activity appear to influence the accessibility of the information about previously read text.

在探索阅读中断对文本理解影响的系列实验中，Glanzer 及其团队（B. Fischer Glanzer, 1986; Glanzer et al., 1981; Glanzer, B. Fischer, Dorfman, 1984）通过在文本逐句阅读中插入无关活动后再恢复阅读的方法进行了研究。Glanzer 及其同事将中断阅读与正常阅读对照条件进行对比时，他们在不同的实验中发现了一种非常一致的普遍模式，即使中断活动的类型不同。最关键的发现是，文本理解的中断并没有明显影响理解问题的回答速度或准确率。中断的主要影响仅体现在恢复阅读后第一句的阅读时间增加。这两个结果表明，中断期间工作记忆中的信息并未遭到无法修复的损失。通过从长期记忆中恢复文本结构的关键元素，可以重新建立上下文和继续理解相关信息的可访问性。

中断后恢复关键信息的速度和易度可能会受到插入活动的影响。由于中断后阅读时间的增加应反映这些信息恢复的时间，因此我们根据中断期间无关活动的类型和持续时间来分析阅读时间的增加情况。

在一项实验中，Glanzer 等人（1981, Exp. 2a）将连续阅读与解决三个简单加法问题的中断进行了比较，发现阅读时间延长了 450 毫秒。与解决一个加法问题的干预相比，三个问题的干预使阅读时间延长了 250 毫秒。虽然没有记录中断的具体持续时间，但即使对三个问题的干预，持续时间也估计不会超过 10 秒。在后续研究中，插入活动的时间延长至约 30 秒。B. Fischer 和 Glanzer（1986, Exp. 2）使用了两轮数字回忆任务作为插入活动，平均持续时间为 31 秒，此活动使得恢复阅读时阅读时间增加了约 1200 毫秒。在其他两项实验（Exp. 3 和 4）中，参与者进行了大约 30 秒的加法验证，阅读时间增加了约 1800 毫秒。干预活动的持续时间和特定类型显然影响了先前阅读文本信息的可访问性。

Glanzer also studied the effect of intervening comprehension of unrelated sentences and different texts, material which would be expected to be maximally interfering. In one experiment (Glanzer et al., 1984, Exp. 1) sentence-by-sentence reading was interrupted by the tasks of reading sentences about unrelated facts, which took around 7 s. The resumed reading time increased by 314 ms. The reading time for the intervening unrelated sentences and subsequent memory for these facts were no different from those observed for a control condition. A subsequent experiment (Glanzer et al., 1984, Exp. 3)increased the duration of the unrelated text comprehension task to around 30 s by having the subjects alternate between two texts. The increase in the time subjects took to resume reading of the primary text was 355 ms. When the unrelated activity was comprehension of a different text, accessibility of information in working memory appeared to remain high even when the duration of the unrelated activity was increased.

In summary, the research by Glanzer and his colleagues shows that the transient portion of working memory (ST-WM) is not necessary for continued comprehension of the type of texts they studied. Their findings are consistent with the view that the necessary information is stored in LTM- WM, where interruptions lead to a loss of the necessary retrieval cues in STM. When the intervening task involves comprehension of unrelated sentences or texts, the additional time for accessing the retrieval cues that allow continued reading is around 350 ms, which is roughly equivalent to other estimates of retrieval from LTM reviewed earlier. When the intervening task is unrelated to reading and has a comparatively long duration (around 30 s), access times are longer and may involve reinstating the task of reading (B. Fischer & Glanzer, 1986; Glanzer & Nolan, 1986).

The hypothesized role of storage of surface structure in STM. The finding that subjects'text comprehension does not seem to be impaired by long interruptions between the reading of consecutive sentences in the text seems to rule out any significant role of transient information in ST-WM. However, this observation runs counter to a long tradition in text comprehension and discourse analysis. Sentences in a text contain references, such as pronouns, to previously presented information and cannot be fully comprehended unless they are successfully resolved. Some researchers have hypothesized that access to the surface form of preceding sentences in ST-WM is necessary for successful linkage between the current sentence and preceding sentences. Glanzer and his colleagues (Glanzer et al., 1981; Glanzer et al., 1984)clearly formulated this idea in their early work. They proposed that what is carried over in short-term memory is the linguistic surface form of the preceding sentence or sentences, uninterpreted semantically or pragmatically.

Glanzer 及其团队深入探索了阅读过程中受到的干扰效应，尤其是当这种干扰来自与阅读材料无关的句子或文本时。在 1984 年的一项实验中，研究人员发现，如果在逐句阅读的过程中插入一些关于完全不相关事实的句子（这个任务大约需要 7 秒），人们重新开始阅读所需的时间会延长约 314 毫秒。更进一步的实验显示，如果这种无关的阅读活动延长到 30 秒（通过让参与者交替阅读两种不同的文本），这种延迟会增加到 355 毫秒。这些研究表明，即使面对干扰，工作记忆中的信息仍然能够被有效地访问。

通过 Glanzer 及其同事的研究，我们了解到，在阅读特定类型的文本时，工作记忆的瞬时部分并非必不可少。他们的发现支持这样一个观点：所需的信息是存储在长期记忆中的，而干扰则会导致短期记忆中重要的检索线索丢失。简而言之，如果干预任务是理解与阅读无关的句子或文本，那么继续阅读所需寻回的线索大约需要额外 350 毫秒的时间，这与之前对长期记忆检索时间的估计大致相当。而如果干预任务持续时间更长且与阅读无关，那么访问这些线索的时间会更长，可能还需要重新启动阅读过程。

此外，研究也探讨了短期记忆中存储文本的表面结构 —— 即句子的字面形式 —— 的作用。尽管长时间的阅读中断看似不会影响人们对文本的理解，这一发现却与文本理解和话语分析的传统观点相冲突。文本中的句子通过代词等引用元素与先前的信息相关联，没有这些信息的成功连接，句子就难以完全理解。一些研究者认为，成功地将当前句子与前文连接起来，需要访问存储在短期记忆中的前面句子的表面形式。Glanzer 和他的团队在早期的工作中已经提出了这一观点，他们认为短期记忆传递的是前一个或几个句子的语言表面形式，而这些并没有在语义或语用层面上进行解释。

Investigators have tried to determine whether intermediate linguistic structures are retained between sentences rather than, or perhaps in addition to, the sentence meaning by examining how much of the preceding sentences subjects can recall verbatim. If subjects are interrupted during reading at randomly selected places and asked to reproduce what they have just read verbatim, they reproduce the last sentence or clause almost perfectly, and the next to the last clause fairly accurately, but cannot produce earlier sentences and clauses (see Jarvella, 1979, for a review). This replicable finding proves only that readers can reproduce most of the surface form of two clauses. Because the subjects in these experiments knew that they would be tested for short-term retention, it is very likely that they used special chunking and rehearsal strategies. Two sentences is therefore almost surely an overestimation of the contents of what is retained verbatim during normal reading, just as the immediate memory span is an overestimation of short-term capacity during list learning (Ğlanzer & Razel, 1974) or reading (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980). In fact, when subjects are informed in advance of the way they will later be tested, their speed and pattern of reading are dramatically influenced by the particular test they anticipate (for example, Aaronson & Ferres, 1984; Kieras, 1984). Thus, the verbatim recall data do not necessitate the assumption that readers hold in memory the uninterpreted surface form of a couple of sentences.

In an effort to demonstrate empirically the role of the surface form of the two preceding sentences in ST-WM, Glanzer et al. (1984) explored the conditions under which the increased reading time after disruption could be eliminated. If, following the interruption, subjects reread the last two sentences before proceeding to the next sentences, no reliable increase of the reading time was observed in Exp. 3. Experiment 4 showed that rereading only the last sentence was sufficient to eliminate the increase in reading time associated with the interruption. In a post hoc analysis of their texts, Glanzer et al. (1984) found that many of the sentences subjects first encountered after the interruption did not have references to the preceding sentences (independent) and therefore did not require linkage information in ST-WM. A reanalysis suggested that the increase in reading time after interruption was greater for dependent sentences which would require linkage information, than for independent sentences. For independent sentences, rereading another independent sentence from the previously read text--not necessarily the last sentence read before the interruption--was found sufficient in Experiment 5 to eliminate the increase in reading time after the interruption. In a subsequent study B. Fischer and Glanzer (1986)systematically varied the dependence and independence of the sentences in their texts and were able to demonstrate larger increases in resumed reading time for dependent than for independent sentences. From the results from their four experiments, B. Fischer and Glanzer (1986) estimated additive increases in resumed reading times to be 408 ms when the increase was due to unavailability of general theme and to be 402 ms when the increase was due to unavailable linkage information (the latter finding only to dependent sentences).




According to our proposal for LT-WM, these results should be interpreted as reflecting the reinstatement of the retrieval cues necessary for accessing the hierarchical structure readers have generated for the previously read text in LTM. Rereading the last sentence of a text is sufficient to activate retrieval cues to the general structure as well as cues pointing to specific information corresponding to the last sentence. Rereading any independent sentence of the prior text provides access only to the general structure (cf. Glanzer et al., 1984, Exp. 5). When there is no opportunity to reread prior sentences, access to the general structure requires around 400 ms; and for dependent sentences, retrieval of the specific information prior to the interruption requires a similar amount of time.

The interruption procedure, therefore, does little more than slow down the reading process a bit, because what is disrupted is neither a perceptual trace nor purely a surface representation of the text, but a fully analyzed, fully interpreted representation of the previous text in long-term memory that is readily accessible in long-term working memory.

ST-WM during reading. Text comprehension has been shown to involve the generation of an integrated representation in LTM of the previously read text. Access to these structures in LTM is mediated by retrieval cues transiently activated in ST-WM. These findings are consistent with our proposal for LT-WM. In this section we argue that storage of these retrieval cues is also consistent with the capacity limits of ST-WM. We review research on the effects of other concurrent activities, some of them explicitly designed to interfere with ST-WM. We then discuss some research directed toward measuring the accessibility of information in working memory.




There are several ways in which retrieval cues to the integrated representation of the text may be coded and maintained in ST-WM, which consists of several types of buffers. The most direct approach to determining how these retrieval cues are stored is to selectively interfere with a buffer by forcing subjects to perform an additional task concurrently with text comprehension. To interfere with the articulatory loop, researchers can instruct subjects to vocalize some unrelated verbalization during reading. This manipulation does not seem to impair normal text comprehension, and decreased comprehension is observed only with difficult text for which information about word order has to be preserved. In a review Baddeley (1986)concluded that the articulatory loop is not typically needed for text comprehension by skilled readers and is used as a supplement to aid in comprehension of difficult text. Additional support for the robustness of comprehension comes from a frequently replicated finding that subjects can read a text aloud without impairing their memory or comprehension of the text (for a review see Ericsson, 1988b), although reading aloud is somewhat slower than silent reading, especially for skilled readers.

The clearest evidence for the distinction between traditional STM and the transient storage of information during text comprehension comes from studies by Baddeley and his colleagues. Subjects performed a STM task concurrently with a task requiring comprehension of sentences and texts. Even when considerable additional information was maintained in STM, comprehension performance was sustained with only minor decrements.

When subiects are asked to hold six digits in memory while reading a sentence and later to reproduce those digits, Baddeley and Hitch (1974) found a decrement in performance of about 10% compared to the performance of subjects who do not have a memory load. In a second experiment, subjects had to memorize three or six visually presented digits while listening to a prose text. With only three digits to learn, subjects answered questions about the text almost as well as a control group did (4% less). With six digits, a significant performance decrement of 18% was obtained (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). Performance decrements exist for comprehension as well as for memory (Baddeley, 1986). In one of Baddeley's studies, subjects had to verify visually presented sentences (as in semantic memory experiments) while remembering from zero to eight spoken digits. The frequency of error increased only when subiects had to remember six or more digits, whereas reaction times increased modestly with memory load.




Results like these show that in dual task situations, text comprehension is relatively unaffected by low and intermediate loads on memory and only really impaired when the resource demands of the secondary task are maximal: Even without anything else to do, individuals can manage to remember six or eight digits at most. As long as they have some free resources, however, they perform remarkably well on text comprehension tasks. These findings imply that the storage of information that makes the representation of the prior text accessible during text comprehension needs to reside in the central executive, according to Baddeley's (1986) model.

In addition to previously discussed findings on activated information during reading through priming several investigators have asked subjects to think aloud during reading. In a review of think- aloud studies Ericsson (1988b) found no evidence that standard think-aloud instructions (Ericsson & Simon, 1993)influenced comprehension compared to silent control subjects. At the same time subjects thinking aloud while reading tend to give very sparse and uninformative reports for well- written easy texts and subjects predominantly read the text aloud. This pattern of verbalizing primarily the presented text during fluent comprehension and only in the case of comprehension difficulties verbalizing deliberate efforts to attain understanding is consistent with our framework (Kintsch, 1988). To gain more information about the stable end-products of comprehension researchers have modified the reading task in think-aloud studies and stop the subjects after each sentence to comment and verbalize the information associated with that state. These verbal reports reflect access to information stored in LT-WM, which we will turn to next.

LT-WM during reading. Evidence for accessibility of the representation of the prior text is largely indirect because successful comprehension would be impossible without such access. A few studies have measured accessibility during text comprehension in a relatively direct fashion, however. While reading subjects been interrupted between consecutive sentences and have been presented specific probes for cued recall or recognition of previously read information, or asked to verbalize their thoughts(think-aloud)or directed to comment or elaborate on the text. Although such interruptions have typically been viewed as very disruptive and incompatible with normal text comprehension, the research we have previously reviewed here on more demanding and unrelated intervening activities showed no reliable evidence of effects on final comprehension.




A small number of studies have compared the effects of thinking aloud and directed commenting with silent reading. No evidence was found that mere thinking aloud influences comprehension and memory of the text, but additional directions to elaborate on the sentences in the text leads to better memory for the text (see Ericsson, 1988b, for a review). When subjects think aloud about a recently read sentence, they verbalize the information in attention (Ericsson Simon, 1993), and further verbalizations should reflect the most directly accessible information. By analyzing the propositional information from the text contained in think-aloud verbalizations, Fletcher (1986) was able to evaluate theoretical models that explain how information is selectively retained in ST-WM to maximize the generation of a coherent text representation. Guindon (1980, 1981) focused her analysis of the think-aloud protocols on the access and generation of verbalized inferences that went beyond the information explicitly provided by the text. A recent series of studies by Trabasso and Suh (1993)represents the most comprehensive effort to analyze information verbalized after each sentence. Trabasso and Suh successfully predicted the frequencies with which specific inferences were verbalized. Most important, they were able to show that verbalized information from one group of subjects could successfully predict priming and retention for different groups reading the same stories silently.

During encoding and storage of the current sentence, the relevant information from the previously read text must remain accessible. Retrieval cues to the hierarchical organization of the encoded text provide access to this information, but direct access is limited to recent information as well as to elements central to the structure. A few studies provide empirical support for this prediction of differential accessibility. Fletcher(1981) tested Kintsch and van Dijk's (1978) formulation of this prediction by interrupting subjects during text comprehension and having them make recognition judgments for arguments of propositions from sentences they had previously read. Recognition times were about 200 ms faster for central propositions that according to Kintsch and van Dijk, should remain accessible, than for other propositions. The speed of access to the central propositions matched that of recently presented propositions, a result suggesting a similar state of immediate accessibility.




Using a related distinction between information describing the topic of a text and information describing the details, Nolan and Glanzer (reported in Glanzer and Nolan, 1986)conducted two experiments in which they interrupted subjects were interrupted during reading and had them make recognition judgments of presented sentences. In the first experiment, Nolan and Glanzer contrasted the currently presented information for both topic and details with information presented three sentences earlier. They found no difference in the recognition times for topic information, but recognition times for previously presented details were around 700 ms longer than for details in the current sentence. Hence, details from previous sentences are not kept directly accessible, but require mediated retrieval.

In a subsequent experiment, recognition of topic and detail statements was compared for information presented in the current paragraph and in the previous paragraph. The only reliable effect was that recognition of details in both paragraphs took around 500 ms longer than did recognition of topics. Accessibility of topic information in both experiments remained high.

Nolan and Glanzer (Glanzer Nolan, 1986) found an intriguing effect on reading times for reading resumed after interruptions with recognition tests. When the recognition test involved topic information from the previous paragraph, the reading times were over a second longer than for topic information from the current paragraph. The same pattern of reading times occurred in recognition tests of details from the previous and current paragraph, although recognition tests of details were associated with 300 ms of additional reading time compared to tests of topic information. This finding clearly suggests that retrieval of prior topic information requires access to and reinstatement of the current structure so that comprehension can continue.




Individual differences in comprehension: encoding skill or general capacity. Several explanations have been proposed for the large individual differences that have been found in text comprehension. The most plausible loci for these individual differences are the capacity to maintain previously presented information in ST-WM or alternatively the acquired skill to encode earlier presented information in accessible form in LT-WM. We will first briefly discuss the traditional view based on differences in the capacity of ST-WM, which has been the major theoretical mechanism to motivate empirical research. Then we will reevaluate the empirical evidence to show that it supports our proposal for skilled encoding and retrieval of information from LT-WM. The evidence we have reviewed so far shows that during text comprehension readers generate relevant inferences and form an integrated representation that is highly resistant to short-term interruptions and thus does not involve ST-WM for storage.

Consistent with Baddeley and his colleagues' observations of only mild interference from a concurrent task during reading, several investigators have been unable to account for individual differences in text comprehension based on individual differences in performance on standard tests of the capacity of STM. Furthermore, dramatic increases in text comprehension from childhood to adulthood do not correspond to comparable increases in the capacity of STM(Case, 1978; Chi, 1976; Dempster, 1981; Huttenlocher & Burke, 1976); there are no reliable differences in memory span for good and poor readers (Farnham-Diggory Gregg, 1975; Rizzo, 1939). These results are inconclusive, however, because the memory span is purely a test of storage capacities for unfamiliar and unrelated information and does not indicate the capacity of working memory available during reading. Working memory has a dual function, processing as well as maintenance. Hence, even an account based on LT-WM requires sufficient capacity of ST-WM to allow retrieval from and encoding of the presented text in LTM as well as maintenance of necessary retrieval cues. Problems with decoding, accessing the meanings of words, retrieval of relevant knowledge, and necessary inferences should all lead to difficulties in the smooth continuation of text comprehension.




Daneman and Carpenter(1980) therefore designed a task to measure the capacity of working memory during reading. They presented subjects with a series of unrelated sentences which they needed to comprehend in order to answer subsequent test questions. At the end of the presentation, subjects were asked to recall as many of the last words of the sentences as possible. The number of words a subject correctly recalled is the subject's reading span. College students manage to recall the last word from one to five sentences; good readers have a significantly higher reading span than poor readers. Reading span correlates with comprehension tests (r=.5 to .6) and with the ability to answer content questions about a previously read text (r=.7 to .9).

Some of the questions required the readers to successfully resolve the referents of pronouns in the text. Subjects with high reading spans gave very accurate answers regardless of the distance between the pronoun and its earlier referent in the text. Subjects with lower spans, however, were less accurate, and the frequency of errors increased as a function of the distance. The correlation between overall accuracy for resolving referents of pronouns and reading span ranged between 0.8 and 0.9. Similar correlations were obtained when the questions involved retrieval of facts presented in the text. Hence, ability to resolve referents of pronouns and ability to recall presented facts are both closely related to reading span. In retrospective reports and observations from the reading-span task, Daneman and Carpenter (1980) found evidence for the subjects' active efforts during reading to encode associations between the last words of the sentences as well as efforts "to reconstruct the sentences on the basis of whatever "gist"had been retained"(p. 457). If superior comprehension is viewed as efficient storage in LTM of information in the text, then the reading-span task may reflect shared skills and mechanisms.




More recent research by Engle and his colleagues (Cantor, Engle Hamilton, 1991; La Pointe Engle, 1990; Turner Engle, 1989) have examined immediate memory performance on a wide range of simple and complex tasks and related it to verbal ability. They have found evidence for individual differences in general working memory capacity as being distinct from differences in STM mediated by rehearsal. Engle, Cantor and Carullo (1992)argue that working memory reflect a general capacity to hold information in LTM activated during processing. Just and Carpenter (1992)hold a similar view with the exception that the capacity limitation is specific to language information. According to our proposal superior text comprehension reflect superior skill in encoding information in LTM thus allowing a larger amount of information to remain accessible by means of sues in ST-WM. The LT-WM and capacity accounts differ in their predictions about storage in LTM and individual differences in factors facilitating processing and storage in LTM.

According to capacity theories the maintenance of words in the reading-span task is solely based on activation (ST-WM). However, subsequent research has accumulated substantial evidence implicating storage in LTM during the reading-span task. Masson and J. A. Miller (1983)found that, in cued recall, other words in the sentences were equally good as predictors of reading comprehension as the final words. Baddeley (1986)found similar correlations between comprehension ability and a modified reading-span test in which subjects were told only after the end of presentation what type of information they had to recall. In this version of the reading-span task, the subjects could not anticipate what information would be requested and therefore had to maintain a great deal of information to perform well. The storage of large amounts of information is consistent only with storage in LTM.



Furthermore, the ability to remember sentences is related to verbal ability and the ability to comprehend text. Masson and J. A. Miller (1983) found that delayed testing of recognition memory for explicit and inferred statements from a paragraph were both as highly related to ability to comprehend text as to the reading span scores. Ericsson and Karat (Ericsson Chase, 1982)found that memory span for words in sentences was highly correlated with a test of verbal ability and that during an incidental memory test at the end of the test session subjects could recal close to 80 percent of the sentences when cued with a unique word from each sentence. Carpenter and Just(1989)have also found a higher memory span for sentences as a function of their subjects'reading span. More recently Cantor and Engle (1993)let two groups of subjects with high and low capacity of WM, respectively, memorize unrelated (Exp. 1)and thematically-related (Exp. 2)sentences. For unrelated sentences they found the typical fan effect for recognition judgments, but the slope of the fan was higher for the low-WM group than the high-WM group. Most interestingly the relation between verbal ability and WM capacity disappeared when the effects of the slope of the fan was controlled. For the thematically-related sentences the low-WM group still revealed a typical fan effect, whereas the high- WM group showed a negative fan, that is the more statements related to a concept the faster the judgments. These findings show simply that the presented sentences are encoded in LTM differently for the two groups. The low-WM group appears to encode the sentences in isolation or in small groups of thematically related ones, whereas the high-WM group is able to attain a more integrated representation of the sentences, especially for the thematically-related sentences. Difficulties to suppress irrelevant information during text comprehension, which have also been observed for older subjects in research on aging (Hasher Zacks, 1988), could be easily accounted for in terms differences in ability to form integrated representations and situational models of the text. Other differences in encoding processes between high-and low-WM subjects were found by Engle et al. (1992). They found that the high-WM subjects allocated their study time better under self-paced study conditions than low-WM subjects.




Text comprehension is closely related to verbal ability, which is often measured by tests of vocabulary and language use (grammar). Test of vocabulary and word meanings are correlated with text comprehension as well as reading span(Dixon, LeFevre, Twilley, 1988). Reading span uniquely predicts text comprehension, even when the influence of word knowledge is statistically controlled. However, knowledge about words is but one of many aspects of skilled readers' knowledge about language and discourse. Reading span is also correlated with the ability to make inferences, although if one partials out subjects' performance on questions asking for information stated explicitly in the text, this relation is no longer significant (Dixon et al., 1988; Masson & J. A. Miller, 1983). Singer, Andrusiak, Reisdorf, and Black (1991) have shown, however, that this correlation depends on the type of inference. Subjects are likely to make bridging inferences as an integral part of constructing a textbase because these inferences are necessary to make the textbase coherent. The correlation of bridging inferences with reading span remains significant even after explicit memory is partialled out, at least when the memory load is substantial (premises are separated by three intervening sentences). On the other hand, subjects are likely to make deductive inferences in response to subsequent test questions, rather than during the reading of the text. Deductive inferences are independent of working memory capacity once explicit memory is accounted for.

Some of the best evidence for our notion of LT-WM and against inherent individual differences in the capacity of temporary working memory comes from research that systematically varies both verbal ability and relevant domain knowledge and studies their effect on text comprehension. Recht and Leslie (1988) selected four groups of subjects on the basis of their reading ability (high and low) and their knowledge about baseball (high and low). Wolfgang Schneider, Körkel, and Weinert (1989) similarly selected four groups based on aptitude(high and low IQ) and knowledge about soccer(high and low). Using a similar factorial design Walker (1987)varied general aptitude with knowledge about baseball. All three studies found that memory and comprehension of texts describing events in soccer or baseball were influenced only by the amount of knowledge (high-low). There was no evidence for a main effect of or an interaction with IQ or reading ability. Hence, students with low reading ability and expert knowledge clearly outperformed students with high reading ability and little knowledge.




In a more recent study Yekovich, Walker, Ogle and Thompson (1990) compared two groups of students of low verbal ability who differed in their knowledge about football (high/low). These students read both texts used in standard tests of text comprehension and texts about football,which were constructed to have structures similar to those in the corresponding standard texts. Comprehension of the texts was found to depend on an interaction between type of text and knowledge level. Students with high knowledge showed better comprehension of the football texts than they did the standard texts, and there was no reliable difference for the students with low knowledge. The largest differences in comprehension corresponded to the highest level of integration and generation of thematic inferences. Yekovich et al. (1990) argued that enriched knowledge about football allowed the students with high-knowledge to generate these inferences in the normal course of comprehending the football texts, as proposed by Kintsch(1988). They offered further support for that claim in a subsequent study by showing that students with a high level of knowledge about football (regardless of high or low verbal ability) could readily generate fluent thematic inferences when they are asked to comment concurrently on a football game.

The high correlations between text comprehension and, on the one hand, measures of long- term memory for texts and sentences and tests of language knowledge (vocabulary and grammar)are consistent with the assertion that text comprehension is an acquired skill. An important aspect of this acquired skill is storage of an integrated representation of the previous text in LTM. The storage itself must be rapid and accurate, and it must allow efficient retrieval of this information whenever needed. We suggest that Daneman and Carpenter's(1980) reading span measures this ability to store and later retrieve information about preceding sentences from LTM. Thus, what we are dealing with in the studies we have reviewed is not maintenance of temporary information in working memory, but skilled readers' ability to access LTM from retrieval cues held in the active portion of working memory.




In sum, Engle, Cantor and Carullo (1992) entertain the possibility that their results on working memory capacity is mediated by Chase and Ericsson's(1982)retrieval structures, but suggest that "there is a limitation either in the number of contexts or the number of links resulting from the limitation in total activation"(p. 990). Just and Carpenter (1992), however, have adduced a great deal of other experimental evidence in favor of their capacity theory of comprehension, in addition to the reading-span results. This theory can take two forms. In the form these investigators favor, the total capacity of working memory varies among individuals. A large capacity makes a good reader because it enables that reader to store more information in working memory during reading. In another version, which fits their data equally well, the total capacity does not differ between good and poor readers, but the processing efficiency of good readers is assumed to be higher, so that their effective working memory capacity is enlarged because they can use their resources better. Our proposal for LT- WM can do without the somewhat slippery notion of cognitive resources altogether. What is limited is merely the transient portion of working memory. Good readers perform better because their superior comprehension strategies result in the construction of better retrieval schemata. All the data Just and Carpenter(1992)report can readily be reinterpreted in this way. For instance, there is no need to claim that only high-span readers have the capacity to take pragmatics into account. Instead, it may be the case that skilled (hence high-span)readers have available sophisticated sentence parsing strategies based on pragmatic information that poor, low-span readers lack. This claim is supported by some very recent research by MacDonald and Pearlmutter (1993), who re-examined a finding by MacDonald, Just and Carpenter (1992)showing that high-span subjects took longer to read temporarily ambiguous sentences than low-span subjects. In contrast to Just and Carpenter's(1992) account in terms of capacity theory MacDonald and Pearlmutter (1993)show that only high-span subjects have sufficient knowledge of language to be sensitive to the probabilistic constraints guiding the ambiguity resolution. These findings and others that we reviewed earlier seriously question Just and Carpenter's(1992)assumption that good and poor readers perform the same operations, but that some have more room in working memory than others. In comparison, our proposal for LT-WM emphasizes good readers' use of more sophisticated, more complex comprehension strategies- procedures for the construction of mental representations that result in the generation of more extensive retrieval structures and hence a larger effective working memory. This interpretation has two advantages. It is parsimonious (no recourse is necessary to ill-specified mental resources that take up cognitive capacity). More important, the kind of retrieval structures that are being built in text comprehension can be specified in some detail, as we show in the next section.

### 07. The Construction of an LTM Representation from Text: The Construction-Integration Model

We now describe a model of comprehension that explains how the processes involved in comprehension result in the construction of retrieval structures and thereby create LT-WM. This model is Kintsch's (1988; 1992a; 1992b; in press-b; Kintsch & Welsch, 1991) construction- integration(CI)model, which extends the theory of discourse comprehension developed by Kintsch and van Dijk (1978) and van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) through hypotheses about the activation and use of knowledge in comprehension. We can only sketch the principal features of the model here while focusing on the memory aspects of the theory.

#### The CI-model

The CI-model is a computational model of discourse comprehension. From the text it receives, it constructs mental representations which serve as the basis for free recall, question answering, priming effects, and other text-related behaviors. The operations used in this construction process simulate important aspects of human comprehension. The representations generated can be regarded as hypotheses about the nature of memory representations of texts in human readers.

The model uses as its input not the text itself but a hard-coded semantic(propositional) representation of the text. That is, it does not deal with problems of sentence parsing. It is concerned with how the individual meaning elements (propositions) are put together to form a coherent representation of the text as a whole. The basic assumption is that the rules for doing so are general, weak, relatively insensitive to the context, and inexact, so that the representations that are generated are full of redundancies, irrelevant information, and contradictions. Hence, a process for satisfying contextual constraints is needed- the integration process to strengthen those elements of the representation that fit together and to weaken or reject those that do not.

Text comprehension is a sequential process. As each meaning element is generated (by means of the weak, approximate rules previously mentioned), it is integrated with the previous elements that are still held in the focus of attention. At sentence boundaries(or, if the sentence is too long, a suitable phrase boundary)the propositional network that has been generated is dropped from the focus of attention, though it remains available in LTM. Thus, what is stored in LTM is fully interpreted, contextually integrated text representations. As the reader proceeds to the next sentence, some of the text elements being processed are be linked with earlier portions of the text stored in LTM and thus serve as retrieval cues for these portions, creating a LT-WM. The mental representation of the text generated by the reader in accordance with the structure of the text thus comes to serve as a retrieval structure.

#### Access to Episodic Text Memory during Comprehension

Successful comprehension implies that the mental representation of the text is coherent, both at the level of the macrostructure of the text and at the local level. Texts are not always written in such a way, however, that a coherent structure can be generated, because the amount of text that can be held in the focus of attention at any point in the process is strictly limited (typically, that amount is the current sentence). It is therefore frequently the case that items from the episodic text memory under construction must be reinstated in the focus of attention to ensure the coherence of the memory representation (since operations of any kind can be performed only on material held in working memory). If the episodic text structure that has been generated is coherent, text elements currently in the focus of attention provide access to these structures. The elements that provide these links are the ones that provide for the linguistic coherence of the text: anaphoric and cataphoric elements in the episodic model of the current text, generic lexical knowledge, as well as contextual features. In a discussion of mental coherence, Givon (in press)emphasizes six classes of coherence elements: referents, temporality, aspectuality, modality/mood, location, and action/script. Hence any proposition located in the previous text and linked to these cues is directly available for reinstatement in the focus of attention through a single, 400-ms retrieval operation. The text structures that are generated in comprehension thus become the retrieval structures of LT-WM.

These structures can be quite complex, consisting partly of the propositional network derived form the text (the textbase), partly of associated knowledge. Situation models are not necessarily of a propositional nature. Imagery may be involved that integrates the text and the reader's domain knowledge and supports and supplements the information given by the text with relevant general knowledge or personal experience. The episodic text memory is therefore a very rich structure that connects text and knowledge as well as personal experience in many ways. As a consequence, a very large amount of information becomes potentially available in LT-WM through this retrieval structure that has been generated incidentally, as an integral part of text comprehension.

To help a reader construct a coherent mental representation of a text or discourse, speakers or writers insert in their texts syntactic cues that serve as processing instructions to the reader. Givon (in press)has described various types of anaphoric cues that indicate the rough location in the mental text structure of a prior referent. For instance, if the prior referent is still activated (usually that means that it was introduced not more than a clause back), the English language indicates a recent mention through zero anaphora or unstressed pronouns (e.g., .He circled it warily as a wolf, [0] studying it from all angles,...). At the other extreme, a definite noun phrase with a modifier is used as a long distance anaphora(e.g., and when finally he stopped within a dozen feet of the dead man...)(See Footnote 2). În fact, language possesses a variety of graded syntactic devices to indicate to the processor just where in the text information that is to be reactivated is located. These are not only anaphoric cues but also cataphoric cues (e.g., referents marked with an indefinite "this" will recur as a central concept in the subsequent text). Syntax also instructs the reader when not to look for prior links but to start a new thematic unit by means of a variety of switching devices. For example, a plain "and"signals continuity (only 16% of the occurrences of "and" were associated with switches in topic in Givon's corpus), whereas an "And"following a period signals the beginning of a new thematic unit (100% switches). Thus, the cues present in a reader's focus of attention not only make possible retrieval from LT-WM but also indicate to the reader when to attempt such retrieval and when not to.

If the text comprehension processes fail to generate a coherent text representation, for example when the text is difficult or poorly written or when the reader lacks the domain knowledge for an adequate situational understanding, the retrieval structures that provide access to this large amount of information are not in place, or rather, are incomplete, and reinstatements may involve time- and resource-consuming searches (e.g., J. R. Miller & Kintsch, 1980). In such cases, the reader must first generate an appropriate retrieval cue, which can be a difficult problem-solving task in itself.

The textbases and situation models that the CI-simulation generates are the retrieval structures necessary for creating LT-WM. Other theories of discourse comprehension are not very different from the CI-model in this respect, however. There may be differences in the details concerning how these structures are generated and what their primary characteristics are, but in principle various kinds of structures would be capable of creating an LT-WM in discourse comprehension. For instance, both Carpenter and Just's READER model (Just & Carpenter, 1987, Chapter 9) and Gernsbacher's structure building approach (Gernsbacher, 1990) yield structures that could support retrieval from LT- WM in ways not very different from those described here. Even the structures generated by computational linguistics theories (e.g., Grosz & Sidner, 1986) could, in principle, serve this function. At some general level, comprehension is simply structure building, and in order for this large structure to be built sequentially in LTM relevant portions of it must remain accessible. This is what LT-WM enables readers to do in comprehending text.

#### Associative Activation of Knowledge during Comprehension

The episodic text structure is formed during comprehension and provides the retrieval structures needed to access prior portions of a text. The reader's already existing domain knowledge provides another source of retrieval structures with which to access relevant knowledge necessary for full understanding of the text.

In the CI-model knowledge is represented as an associative network. Lexical items as well as propositions encountered in a text associatively activate a few of their neighbors in this network. This associative activation does not take context into account, except that compound cues also can retrieve associated knowledge (Ratcliff & McKoon, 1988).

Consider as an example the following sentence pair (previously analyzed by J. R. Miller & Kintsch, 1980): "Eva Benassi was dying. She recovered from illness when her nurse prayed to the bishop". The first sentence may retrieve "funeral," "she recovered from illness" may retrieve "health," and "her nurse prayed to the bishop" may retrieve "religion" by themselves; but all three items together probably would retrieve "miracle." Neither "funeral," "health," or "religion" would be particularly context-appropriate in this case and would be suppressed by the contextual integration process; but "miracle" is just the right piece of knowledge. In a network consisting only of these nodes and starting out with equal activation for the three text proposition and no activation for the retrieved knowledge items, "miracle" becomes the most highly activated proposition - stronger than the text propositionsl themselves, whereas the other three knowledge items end up with only weak activation values. The model has, thus, inferred the topic of the passage.

Just as it is often necessary to reinstate textual information in the focus of attention during comprehension, it is also often necessary to retrieve general knowledge (or personal experiences) that is needed for the interpretation of the text (the construction of the situation model). The role that knowledge inferences play in text comprehension is varied and important (see Kintsch, 1993). Our concern here is solely with the memory retrieval requirements in inferencing. The resource demands of inferences in text comprehension differ widely. Some are quite automatic, whereas others may require a great deal of directed problem-solving activity.

Consider the contrast between the following two sentence pairs: "John's car broke down. The motor just quit." versus "An abnormally low amount of hydrocele was found. The spermatic cord appeared quite dry." A bridging inference is required in both cases, but the inference is trivial in the first case: The knowledge that cars have motors and that the motor quitting is sufficient cause for a car to break down is readily available; "car" and "motor" are effective retrieval cues that bring the relevant parts of LTM into working memory, so that a coherence problem does not even arise. But "hydrocele" and "spermatic cord" retrieve nothing for most readers. Either the sentence pair remains incoherent, or the reader engages in deliberate, conscious inference processes, hypothesizing, for instance, that because the spermatic cord was dry, it might be the place where a substance called hydrocele was low.

Domain knowledge plays a large role in text comprehension and memory (e.g., Afflerbach, 1990; Bransford Johnson, 1972; Dooling Lachman, 1971; Moravcsik Kintsch, 1993; Recht Leslie, 1988; Wolfgang Schneider et al., 1989; Spilich, Vesonder, Chiesi, & Voss, 1979). Domain knowledge provides the retrieval structures that give readers direct access to the information they need when they need it. Given a richly interconnected knowledge net, the retrieval cues in the focus of attention can access and retrieve a large amount of information. For instance, Kintsch and Keenan (1973)gave subjects sentence pairs such as the following to read: "A burning cigarette was carelessly discarded. The fire destroyed many acres of virgin forest, or sentence pairs in which the first sentence contained the explicit information that the "cigarette started a fire." Subjects then verified test sentences such as "A discarded cigarette started a fire." Reaction times were 400 ms (in another experiment with longer texts, 500 ms) faster when subjects had read the explicit statements than when they had to make the bridging inference on their own. On the other hand, when the test question was delayed for 20 m, there was no difference between conditions, presumably because retrieval from LTM was involved in both cases. Apparently, the retrieval of the episodic text structure also retrieved the associated knowledge about the general world, so that the information that burning cigarettes may cause forest fires was available in working memory, whether stated explicitly in the text or not. The 400-500 ms retrieval times are in good agreement with other estimates of retrieval times for LT-WM.

#### The Role of the Short-term Memory Buffer in Comprehension

In the Kintsch and van Dijk (1978) model and its successors,a limited-capacity, STM buffer plays an important role in comprehension. By maintaining information in working memory, the STM buffer facilitates the construction of a coherent textbase. A small number of propositions are selected at the end of each processing cycle and carried over in a buffer to be reprocessed with the input propositions from the next processing cycle.

The size of the buffer in various applications of the Kintsch and van Dijk (1978) model has been estimated as between one and four propositions (Kintsch van Dijk, 1978; J. R. Miller Kintsch, 1980; Spilich, 1983; Spilich et al., 1979). This estimate agrees well with other estimates of STM capacity. If all resources can be used for storage, as in a memory-span test, about seven to nine chunks can be retained (G. A. Miller, 1956). If, on the other hand, subjects learn a word list for later free recall, a task for which most resources are devoted to encoding of information in LTM rather than short-term storage, only about two items are reproduced from STM(Glanzer Razel, 1974). The model requires the specification of a strategy for selecting propositions to be kept in the short-term buffer. Several successful strategies have been proposed and evaluated empirically (for reviews see Fletcher and Bloom, 1988; Kintsch, 1992a.)

The data cited in support of the short-term buffer are readily accounted for by LT-WM. Instead of assuming that a number of propositions are stored in a short-term buffer we propose that a comparable function is performed by the elements in STM that provide context and access to the relevant portions of the structure of text in LTM. We have already shown how this model can account for selective and rapid access to important propositions and their arguments, because they are part of the LTM structure that encodes the current situation model kept accessible by elements in STM. Given that LT-WM allows readers to maintain access to the important propositions at higher levels in the text hierarchy, it can account for the widely documented "levels effect" in text recall: The more superordinate propositions in a text are recalled better than subordinate propositions are (Kintsch, 1974; Meyer,1975.)

An account of these phenomena in terms of LT-WM has, in addition, the advantage that it is not necessary to propose a separate strategy for selection of propositions for the short-term buffer. The comprehension process encodes new information into the structure of the text in LTM, and accessibility of propositions and other information is an indirect consequence of comprehension.

### 08. Summary

During fluent reading of well-written texts, mental representations of successive sentences are generated in ST-WM. Elements of that representation are linked both to parts of the previously constructed text representation(the episodic text memory), which is already stored in LTM, and to the reader's knowledge. This linkage creates a LT-WM that provides direct access to relevant parts of these structures from the cues available in STM. Once the reading of the text is completed, tests of comprehension and recall reflect the representation of the text in LTM.

Our model of working memory in text comprehension is distinguished from alternative models based on transient activation of information in STM by the central role of storage of accessible information in LTM. Consistent with our model, subjects' reading can be completely disrupted for over 30 s with no observable impairment of subsequent text comprehension. The observed increases in reading time, which are restricted to the first sentence after reading is resumed, occur because elements of the text structure have to be retrieved from LTM in order to reinstate the information available in STM before the interruption.

The construction of an integrated representation of a text in LTM is a skilled activity that requires prerequisite knowledge as well as encoding skills if an individual is to be able to successfully anticipate future retrieval demands. Differences in knowledge about the general topic of the text have been repeatedly shown to influence memory as well as comprehension of a text. Lack of prerequisite knowledge impairs both encoding and storage in LTM and the ability to generate the inferences needed to create an integrated representation The empirical evidence on individual differences in comprehension of standard texts is consistent with differential ability to encode information in LTM in a form that allows subsequent reliable access when this information is referenced or relevant. Differences in domain knowledge and knowledge of different genres of text are correlated with successful encoding abilities. Finally, the CI-model explains how LT-WM is involved in the construction of mental representations during text comprehension.

### 09. Memory in Problem Solving and Other Cognitive Activities

It is relatively easy to extend our proposal for LT-WM to most laboratory studies of problem solving and other types of complex cognitive activities. Many findings (discussed in the introduction) can be adequately accounted for by the classical model, in which cognitive processes are represented by a sequence of states of information in STM. In our view, however, the sufficiency of the classical model of working memory in accounting for many results in studies of problem solving and other complex activities is due to careful selection of laboratory tasks and stimuli to elicit these cognitive processes. Experimental psychologists have traditionally attempted to design laboratory tasks and situations that enable them to study a particular mental function in its purest form. Hence they have tried to minimize the role of memory in their studies of problem solving, thinking, reasoning, and decision making. In earlier studies, researchers tended to select task domains that were unfamiliar to subiects and hoped thereby to eliminate the influence of specific, pre-existing knowledge on the cognitive processes under observation. All the information necessary to perform the tasks therefore had to be presented to the subiects. Investigators alleviated the demand for memory storage in most studies by letting the information remain perceptually available during the task. Newell and Simon (1972)referred to perceptually available information as being accessible from external memory.

In addition. several characteristics of these unfamiliar tasks make use of LT-WM for storage difficult if not impossible. By definition, the stimuli used in an unfamiliar task do not correspond to pre-existing knowledge, which would have facilitated encoding and storage in LTM. Furthermore, the stimuli are often combinations of independent features that would maximize interference for encoding into and retrieval from LTM of stimuli subiects have seen previously. Finally, when subjects are unfamiliar with a task, they do not know what aspects of the information are important. Any efforts subiects would otherwise make to selectively store information with appropriate retrieval cues are therefore virtually impossible.

As subjects gain extensive experience with an initially unfamiliar task, they acquire a good deal of specific knowledge and develop procedures for generating answers and solutions. Hence, with extensive experience in a given task or domain, subiects can overcome the obstacles for using storage in LTM. Consistent with the superior memory of experts, reviewed in the introduction, subjects can extend working memory by acquiring memory skills for specific types of skilled cognitive activities.

Many types of skilled performance involve specific activities that can be easily distinguished from other everyday activities. In contrast, text comprehension involves language and comprehension skills that are closely related to most school and everyday activities. For this reason the amount of experience and improvement in comprehension are very hard to measure and distinguish from improvements due simply to maturation. Skilled performance therefore offers better opportunities to study the emergence of extended working memory as a function of practice and experience. It is possible to investigate working memory capacity and its mediating mechanisms in expert performance by studying individuals who differ in their level of performance in a domain.

We will begin our review of skilled performance by examining some simple skills in tasks for which investigators can dramatically increase demands on memory by eliminating external storage and requiring subjects to perform the tasks mentally. Then we consider increasingly complex skills and compare the performance of experts and novices in several domains.

### 10. Mental Calculation

Calculation in mathematics is taught in school systems all over the world, and the methods and strategies that guide cognitive processes in this domain are well understood. For mathematical problems students are typically allowed to use paper and pencil, a slide rule, an abacus, or in these times an electronic calculator to externalize storage of intermediate products and results. By restricting access to external storage and forcing subjects to carry out the calculation mentally, investigators can create an interesting case for which both the cognitive processes and demands on working memory can be explicated. The demands on working memory in mental calculation differ depending on the type of problem and mathematical operation involved. Here we will consider only addition and multiplication. 

#### Mental Addition

For most adults, adding multi-digit numbers with paper and pencil is easy. When they have to keep all the information in memory, however, they often produce incorrect answers. Hitch (1978) found that subjects adding numbers such as 325 +46 often made errors. These errors were not random but could be predicted by the length of time subjects had to keep the digits generated for the answer in STM before reporting the answer. Untrained subjects apparently kept intermediate products and results primarily in transient STM, which decays rapidly unless it is rehearsed.

Studies of skilled subjects performing complex addition have been conducted primarily in Japan with experienced abacus operators. The task is typically to add sequentially presented numbers up to nine digits long on a perceptually available abacus. The current subtotal is represented on the abacus, and each new presented number is added to it. Hence, there is no benefit from storing any subtotals except the most recent one. Of particular relevance to working memory, the abacus operators who are most frequently studied are able to perform the addition task mentally and report relying on a mental abacus. Calculation with a mental abacus is by no means an automatic consequence of extensive experience with a physical abacus, and most investigators(Stigler, 1984)view mental calculation as a separate skill acquired through practice specifically on mental problems. Acquiring a mental abacus is a slow process that starts with the ability to represent 3 or 4 digits. The rule of thumb is that expanding the mental abacus by one additional digit takes about one year of deliberate effort (Hatano Osawa, 1983).

Calculation with a mental abacus leads to the same type of errors as working with a real abacus does, and these errors are markedly different from the errors in mental calculation produced by American subjects (Stigler, 1984). Furthermore, Stigler (1984) found that skilled abacus calculators appear to have access to distinct descriptions of intermediate states of the abacus even during mental addition. When the calculators were asked to monitor for a specific configuration of beads of the abacus during a calculation, their pattern of reaction times is similar for both mental calculation and calculation with an actual abacus.

Several investigators have studied differences in memory capacity and representation as a function of level of skill in mental abacus calculation. Subjects with higher skill levels have a larger memory capacity for digits, as measured by the digit span(Hatano, Amaiwa, Shimizu, 1987). Elite-level subjects have exceptional digit spans between 12 and 16 digits, but their memory capacity for other types of materials is within the normal range (Hatano & Osawa, 1983). Subjects with higher skill levels show evidence of a different type of memory encoding of presented digits. Articulatory suppression has considerable effects on the memory performance of less skilled subjects, but no effect is observed for skilled subjects (Hatano et al., 1987; Hatano Osawa, 1983). The effect of a concurrent visual-spatial task is greater for elite than for less skilled subjects (Hatano Osawa, 1983). Experts' memory for digits is affected more by exposure to irrelevant abacus configurations than exposure to lists of digits during a retention interval, whereas less skilled subjects show the reverse paitern of interference (Hatta, Hirose, Ikeda, & Fukuhara, 1989).

The accessibility of presented digits in memory also changes as a function of skill level from a sequential organization to a more flexible representation that allows order-independent access. When experts are instructed to report presented digits in reverse order(backward digit span), their digit span is not affected. The performance of less skilled subjects is reliably reduced in this task (Hatano et al., 1987). Cued recall of digits represented within the mental abacus elicited no increases in experts' reaction time as a function of serial position, whereas less skilled subjects showed the typical linear increase in reaction time associated with a sequential representation of stored digits (Hishitani, 1990).

There is controversy over how the mental abacus should be characterized in terms of working memory. Hatano and Osawa(1983) performed one experiment that they claimed ruled out storage in LTM. Two elite subjects were asked to maintain ten digits for 30 s for ten consecutive lists, after which they were given a surprise recall and recognition test. One of the subjects could accurately recall the last list, but otherwise these subjects exhibited no evidence for memory of the presented lists. This result is not inconsistent, however, with notion that the mental abacus is an instance of LT-WM.

The demands on working memory in mental abacus calculation require that during addition of a new number, the current subtotal be updated digit by digit in an independent manner. Hence, the most plausible implementation of LT-WM would be storage or activation of an encoding of the locations of one or more beads for each of the relevant positions on the abacus. With each operation (addition of individual digits)a new configuration of locations would be linked to that position. Because the same spatial position cue is continuously reused, interference with a previously stored (activated)memory process should be a major problem. Indeed, it explains the poor memory for previously seen lists of digits that Hatano and Osawa (1983) observed in their elite subjects. Our account in terms of LT-WM is superior to alternatives involving ST-WM in that it easily accommodates the restriction of the superior memory capacity to only numbers and the long period of relevant training necessary to attain this domain-specific form of extended working memory.

#### Mental Multiplication

The problem of multiplying two multi-digit numbers is a natural extension of addition because addition is à significant component of multiplication. Similar to addition problems, multiplication problems offer most educated individuals no real difficulty when paper and pencil are available for external storage. When multiplication has to be completed without any external memory aid, it becomes a most challenging task. Unlike mental addition of a list of sequentially presented numbers, where only a single subtotal has to be kept in memory, mental multiplication requires intermittent access to the numbers of the original problem and to calculated intermediate products during most of the calculation process, which can take up to several minutes to complete.

Like mental abacus calculation, mental multiplication is a distinct skill that requires specific practice beyond extended experience of multiplication with paper and pencil. All of the most outstanding mental calculators (Hunter, 1962; Jensen, 1990; S. B. Smith, 1983) spent many years practicing before achieving their superior performance. Large individual differences in mental calculation among college students were found to be closely related to prior amounts of specific experience(Dansereau, 1969). In an extended training study, Staszewski (1988b)showed that after hundreds of hours of practice, ordinary college students could improve their mental calculation performance by a factor of 5 and match the performance of a professional performer on arbitrary multiplication problems in a particular format used in practice.

Research on outstanding mental calculators has shown that most of them have accumulated a vast body of knowledge about mathematics and methods of calculation (Hunter, 1962; S. B. Smith, 1983), which would be very difficult and time consuming to describe. Hence investigators have concentrated on examining the basic capacities and abilities of these mental calculators as measured by standard psychometric tests. The pattern of results is remarkably clear: mental calculators have exceptional memory for digits, but their memory for other types of material is within the normal range (Ericsson, 1985; Jensen, 1990). Although their digit span is typically outside of the normal range, however, it is still below 18. Thus, a mental calculator who has decades of intense experience with numerical calculation only attains a level of performance on the digit-span task that normal college students can attain after less than 50 hours of specific practice (Ericsson, 1985), which is only a minute fraction fo the 10,000 hours estimated to be necessary to attain high levels of expert performance (See Ericsson, Krampe and Tesch-Römer, 1993, for a review).

Most systematic studies of working memory during mental multiplication have been restricted to college students. In an early study of a single subject, Dansereau and Gregg (1966) found that this subject's time to complete mental multiplications could be fairly well predicted by the number of operations necessary for solving these problems with the paper and pencil method. In a remarkable study Dansereau (1969) went beyond the obviously incorrect assumption that all operations would take the same amount of time and tried to estimate the duration of each operation. Using estimates from think-aloud protocols and performance on several specifically designed tasks, he estimated storage and retrieval time for LTM and STM. To simulate the performance of his subjects, however, he also had to postulate an intermediate-term memory store with its own time parameters. This memory store had temporal characteristics for storage and retrieval comparable to our estimates for LT-WM. Most importantly, individual differences in mental-calculation skill were associated with large differences in the speed of storage in and retrieval from this store. Consistent with the acquired nature of LT-WM, the memory of the best and most experienced calculators was the most efficient.

In an extended training study Staszewski (1988b) was able to trace the changes in the processes his subjects used as they dramatically improved their performance of mental calculations. Subjects developed strategies to encode intermediate results for efficient retrieval. With practice they needed less time to store information in LTM and were better able to later recall most of the multiplication problems they had encountered during a session. These findings clearly demonstrate storage in LTM during mental calculation. Furthermore, Staszewski found evidence for the specificity of LT-WM. Throughout training his subjects had solved problems in which a 2-digit, 3-digit, 4-digit or 5-digit number is multiplied by a 2-digit number and only two intermediate products are generated. With these problems one of his subjects matched the solution times of an experienced mental calculator. When tested on problems for which a 3-digit number is multiplied by another 3-digit number, which requires calculation of three intermediate products, this trained subject's solution times were twice those of the experienced mental calculator. A likely source of the difficulty of transfer to the new problem type concerns the inadequacy of the old retrieval structure to accommodate efficient and reliable storage of one additional intermediate result.

Further evidence for encoding in LT-WM during mental calculation was obtained by Chase (Chase Ericsson, 1982). He analyzed a mental calculator who specialized in squaring 3-, 4-, and 5- digit numbers. This expert had discovered an algorithm for squaring that dramatically reduced the memory load; but even so, he had to store a small number of intermediate results without intervening rehearsal for a significant portion of the calculation period. Chase found that his subject used mnemonic methods to encode these intermediate results but did not use these methods for other temporary results. This result is particularly interesting in that is shows that an expert selects different encoding methods to fit the specific retrieval demands of different intermediate results within a given calculational procedure

In summary, working memory in mental addition and multiplication is consistent with the two types of encodings we proposed for LT-WM. Rapidly changing intermediate results in mental abacus calculation and during addition in mental multiplication are stored by activation of a code that links the result and its retrieval cue, whenever proactive interference limits the duration of reliable access. Intermediate results and information about the problem in mental multiplication must be deliberately stored in LTM for retrieval to be accurate and reliable in the absence of intervening access over long periods of time.

### 11. Other Everyday Activities

Most everyday activities are so habitual and adapted to their social and physical environments that it is difficult to assess their structure and demands on working memory. Every since Ebbinghaus (1885/1964), investigators have recognized the relation between knowledge, interest and accuracy of memory for new information in a domain. In this paper we have reviewed the evidence for superior memory in experts and individuals who know a great deal about a domain. A large body of experimental studies of memory shows that memory for a specific type of material improves with practice (Ericsson, 1985). Think-aloud protocols have revealed that individual differences in memory performance reflect differences in relevant knowledge (Gilhooley et al., 1988)and in encoding strategies, which can be improved by instruction (Thorndyke Stasz, 1980). Some of the largest differences in memory performance are found for memory tests that capture naturally reoccurring situations. Many sports fans obtain information about the results of matches between sports teams as a list, often heard on the radio or TV. The amount of knowledge of soccer was found to be a powerful determinant(r >0.8) of subjects'recall of newly presented scores for recent soccer matches(Morris, Tweedy, & Gruneberg, 1985). Even for lists of simulated soccer matches to which a score was randomly assigned, accuracy of recall increased with knowledge of soccer, but the strength of the relation was weaker than for actual soccer scores.

Further evidence of working memory in everyday activities can be found in waiters and waitresses, who repeatedly take drink or dinner orders from large parties of customers. Typically, these individuals write down the information especially for complex dinner orders, in a systematic fashion. Many experienced waiters and waitresses memorize the orders, however, because by doing so they can be more attentive to the customers and thereby earn a larger tip. While memorizing orders, they have to be wiling to explain and describe menu items, accommodaté customers who change their minds, and so forth. Hence, in real life, memory skills must be compatible with interruptions and many other concurrent activities that demand attention.

Superior memory for drink orders (Bennett, 1983) and dinner orders (Ericsson Polson, 1988a; 1988b) in experienced waiters and waitresses has been studied with laboratory analogs of the real situation in restaurants. From interviews at the end of the experimental sessions, Bennett(1983) found that expert waitresses encoded drink orders by linking the order to the corresponding person and location at the table. At the time of recall they could retrieve these orders by using the table with its seating locations as direct cues for the drink orders or for the customers, where the cues linked to the customers in turn might provide access to their drink orders. The same kind of encoding methods were revealed in concurrent verbal reports (Ericsson Simon, 1993)collected from skilled waiters and waitresses by Crutcher and Ericsson (Ericsson & Polson, 1988b). The exception to this pattern was an exceptional subject (JC), who could memorize dinner orders from up to 20 customers, an unusually high number. Ericsson and Polson (1988a, 1988b)interviewed JC and designed a series of experiments to study his memory performance. Consistent with subjects in other studies of memory skills, JC reported that he only gradually acquired his exceptional memory performance. He started with parties of small numbers of new customers and then moved on to increasingly larger parties over a period of several years. From think-aloud protocols recorded while he memorized dinner orders, Ericsson and Polson (1988a)found that JC did not memorize a dinner order by associating it directly to the customer. Each dinner order in the laboratory analog situation consisted of an entrée for a beef dish, a cooking temperature (e.g., medium rare), a starch (e.g., baked potato), and a salad dressing. JC had devised a coding system by means of which he encoded all items of a category, such as the starches, together in a pattern linked to the location at the table. JC could then exploit the frequent repetitions of the same starch for different customers, which caused interference and confusion for the other subjects in the memory experiments, could now be used by JC to encode regular patterns, such as rice, fries, fries, rice. JC encoded salad dressings by their first letters (e.g., B=blue cheese, O=oil and vinegar), which he could often encode again as words (e.g., BOOT), or abbreviations and acronyms(e.g. HBO). He"visualized"cooking temperatures on a scale from rare to well-done and formed spatial patterns, for example, "well done" down to "medium rare" back to "well done."For parties of more than four or five customers JC could split the list of categories into sublists of four customers organized by location around the table in clock-wise order.

While thinking aloud during the study of dinner orders JC would access and verbalize previously presented items in a category in order to encode a pattern for the entire sublist of four items. An analysis of his study times for individual dinner orders showed a clear increase until the sublist of all four items had been encoded (Ericsson Polson, 1988b). After this point a clear decrease in study time was observed for the fifth dinner order, followed by a gradual increase until the second sublist of four items had been completely presented. Furthermore, JC would recall the studied dinner orders by category with the items reported in a consistent clock-wise direction.

Ericsson and Polson(1988b) designed a series experiments to validate the organization of the retrieval structure inferred from JC's reports and performance. They systematically varied the order in which the items were presented and found the same order of recall regardless of the order in which the items had been presented. JC's encoding of the presented information into the retrieval structure was further supported by an analysis of think-aloud protocols(Ericsson Polson, 1988a). In two other experiments they also varied the type of material presented to JC for memorization. As long as the semantic structure of the new materials allowed JC to apply his old encoding methods and retrieval structure, he adjusted quickly to these changes. When conditions were changed so much that this retrieval structure could no longer be applied, however, JC's performance deteriorated and he resorted to the less efficient strategies used by other waiters.

JC's memory performance was based on storage in LTM (Ericsson Polson, 1988a). When JC was unexpectedly tested on his memory for dinner orders taken from customers in the restaurant, where he worked, his recalled most of the information with high accuracy. His post-session recall of dinner orders presented during the testing in the laboratory was very good for the most recent list for all different lengths of lists. However, he also showed strong effects of retroactive interference. When dinner orders for two tables with the same number of customers were presented in a session he could only recall the most recent list of dinner orders with high accuracy.

Differences in memory performance and the capacity of working memory in many everyday activities implicate differences in encoding processes and storage in LTM. The best performance can be linked to skills acquired in response to naturally occurring situations that necessitate rapid storage of information. This performance is mediated by retrieval structures and efficient encoding methods.

#### 12. Medical Expertise

Experts in medicine gather and integrate different types of information in order to determine the correct action in complex situations. Medical diagnosis is particularly relevant to issues of working memory because symptoms and information about a given patient are received piece by piece over an extended time. These conditions raise the issue of interim storage prior to generation of a correct diagnosis. Moreover, medical diagnosis has been extensively studied under controlled laboratory conditions because it has been possible to generate laboratory analogs of these real-life tasks with vignettes about actual patients in such a way that the superior diagnostic accuracy of medical experts is preserved.

Expertise in diagnosing medial pathologies in a specific area of medicine is acquired over a long period of time. Before students can enter medical school, they must acquire certain prerequisite knowledge about science. Studies in medical school last for around five years and are then followed by specialized training in a specific field of medicine. Medical experts have typically had an additional five to ten year of experience in treating patients in their area of specialization. Diagnostic accuracy increases monotonically as a function of training and experience(Patel Groen, 1991; Schmidt and Boshuizen, 1993).

In a laboratory analog of the medical diagnosis task, subjects are either presented with a text describing a particular patient or given the same information sentence by sentence (Boshuizen Schmidt, 1992; Patel & Arocha, 1993; Patel & Groen, 1986). The most salient similarity between normal text comprehension and medical diagnosis is that the end results should reflect an integrated and accurate representation of the presented information. However, the intermediate steps toward this goal differ. A well-written text guides the reader in building the correct representation by including appropriate rhetorical signals that emphasize important information. In contrast, the description of a patient simply lists information. Only at the point when the correct medical diagnosis is generated can final decisions about the importance of individual facts and the relations between them be made. If information is prematurely disregarded or incorrectly encoded in light of an early incorrect diagnostic hypothesis, it is difficult to recover and generate the correct diagnosis. It is thus necessary to limit encodings of encountered information to inferences that remain invariant across alternative diagnostic hypotheses.

Empirical evidence on diagnostic expertise is consistent with the acquisition of a retrieval structure that allow experts to encode basic medical facts about a patient into higher level diagnostic facts(Patel Arocha, 1993)that can be used to access the correct diagnostic category and specific diagnosis. This hypothesis leads to a number of empirically testable predictions. First, the relevant information about the patient should remain accessible after its presentation. Second, experts should be relatively insensitive to the order in which information is presented and at the time of recall, reveal an order of recall that reflects the associated retrieval structure(as JC did with dinner orders).

A large number of studies have examined recall of information about patients as a function of medical expertise (See Patel & Groen, 1991 and Schmidt & Boshuizen, 1993, for reviews). When exposure to a medical case is limited, recall increases as a function of level of expertise. When more time is available to study the case, however, an inverse-U function typically relates recall and expertise. Recall by subjects with an intermediate level of expertise is higher than that of both less and more experienced subjects (Schmidt Boshuizen, 1993). This surprising result appears to be due to two complementary factors. When students are asked to memorize information, their recall of all presented information increases compared to a condition in which they are asked to diagnose the patient and incidental recall is measured. Experts show the reverse pattern, and their incidental memory for the patient is higher when they are offering a diagnosis than when they are asked to memorize the information (G. R. Norman et al., 1989). Part of the problem is that the dependent variable measures recall of all the presented information, whereas adequate comprehension of the case reflects only the significant information.

A more refined analysis by Patel, Groen and their colleagues (see Groen Patel, 1988, for a review) found support for this interpretation. Schmidt and Boshuzien (1993), however, found evidence for another related factor. From think-aloud studies of medical diagnosis, Boshuizen and Schmidt(1992) found that with increasing levels of expertise, subjects did not need to consult their biomedical knowledge to relate facts and symptoms of patients to diagnosis, but were able to use their clinical knowledge directly. In support of that hypothesis, Schmidt and Boshuzien (1993) were able to show that experts' free recall became more abstract and summary-like as their level of expertise increased. Fact recall was replaced by higher level statements that subsumed the specific facts. After extensive clinical experience, medical experts are able to acquire higher level concepts that can be induced from data on patients and allow for more effective reasoning about medical diagnosis. This representation allows medical experts to process information about typical patients in a bottom-up mode using forward-reasoning strategies (Patel Groen, 1991) similar to normal text comprehension, as in Kintsch's(1988) construction integration model(Schmidt & Boshuizen, 1993).

It is difficult to determine how information about a patient is stored in memory because recall about a patient typically reflects the orderly organization in which the information was initially presented in the description of the patient. Analyses of subject's order of recall have suggested schemas for patient information organized by categories (Claessen Boshuizen, 1985). Evidence for such an organization was obtained by Coughlin and Patel (1987), who presented experts and students with both a typically organized description of a patient and a version with the same sentences in scrambled order. Although subjects were given the same amount of time to study both types of descriptions, the diagnostic accuracy of experts was largely unaffected by scrambling and was higher than for the students.

A reanalysis of the order of recall for the scrambled texts (Groen Patel, 1988)showed that all the experts and most of the students reorganized the presented information and recalled it in categories, as proposed by Claessen and Boshuizen (1985). A similar result was obtained by G. R. Norman et al. (1989) for laboratory-test results of patients. They compared recall by novices, students and experts for two different organizations of the laboratory test results --one organized in meaningful, familiar categories and the other scrambled. Recall was unaffected when the order was scrambled, and the amount of recall increased monotonically with level of expertise. An analysis of the order of recall showed that the experts and to a lesser degree the medical students reproduced even the scrambled lists according to their appropriate conceptual categories.

Although the concept of LT-WM has not been explicitly considered in research on medical expertise, there is consistent evidence that experts store information about patients that they use to generate accurate diagnoses and that they can reliably recall upon request. Furthermore, intriguing evidence for a retrieval structure is provided by several studies in which subjects reorganized scrambled information into a semantically meaningful structure consistent with a patient schema. Finally, Patel and Groen and colleagues (Groen Patel, 1988; Patel Groen, 1991)have shown that experts can provide clear explanations for their diagnoses and fully account for all of the relevant presented information. It is reasonable to assume that a critical function of LT-WM in medical experts is not only to attain the correct diagnosis but to provide working memory support for reasoning about and evaluation of diagnostic alternatives. Long-Term Working Memory 40

### 13. Chess

Chess was the first domain of expertise to be systematically investigated (Chase Simon, 1973; de Groot (1946/1978), and it has remained the most studied domain in cognitive psychology. It is thus not surprising that the most extensive evidence on LT-WM has been accumulated in this domain. Chess is an attractive domain to study because it has a very large number of active players and the better players have a chess rating, based on their performance in chess tournaments,that reliably measures their chess skill on an interval scale (Elo, 1986). As is the case for other types of expert performance it is difficult to study the chess experts' cognitive processes as they naturally unfold during chess games. De Groot (1946/1978) therefore devised a task that captures the essence of chess which is to select consistently the best move for a chess position. In his task, an unfamiliar mid-game chess position is presented and subjects select the best next move. Performance on the move-selection task is highly correlated with official chess ratings(Charness, 1991; de Groot, 1946/1978; Saariluoma, 1990).

By having chess experts think aloud while they select their move, de Groot (1946/1978)found evidence for extensive planning and evaluation of possible move sequences before the subjects announced the selected move. Transcripts of the protocols reveal that some of the best players(grand masters)were quickly able to identify the best potential moves, whereas other grand masters uncovered the best move during systematic exploration and evaluation (de Groot, 1946/1978). Hence, systematic evaluation appears necessary to guarantee highly accurate selection of moves. When de Groot analyzed the depth and other characteristics of very advanced chess players' search processes, he did not find any systematic differences related to differences in chess skill. In a subsequent study of chess players whose skill differed more widely, Charness(1981b) found a reliable relation between the maximum number of chess moves planned ahead (depth of search)and chess skill. Saariluoma (1991a)found that chess masters generated potential moves much faster and more fluently than novices in chess. Charness (1989) and Saariluoma (1990, 1992) have shown that the depth of planning during the selection of a move increases with chess skill up to the level of an advanced chess expert. The absence of further increases in depth of planning appears to be due not to lack of ability but to the emergence of a more sophisticated focus of evaluation and abstract planning (Saariluoma, 1990,1992).

Planning during move selection imposes a major load on working memory. Saariluoma (1991a)has studied the effect on move generation from concurrent tasks that interfere with the articulatory loop and the visual-spatial scratch pad (Baddeley, 1986). He found no effect from articulatory suppression but did find a reliable effect from concurrent visual-spatial tasks(Saariluoma, 1991a). The effect did not differ for chess masters and novices, however, and the visual-spatial tasks may draw on central resources of perception and attention rather than selectively interfering with working memory.

The critical demand on working memory in skilled chess playing is the need to plan the consequences of long sequences of moves. Consistent with other skills that are acquired, the ability to plan increases during the first few years of serious chess study. Furthermore, the representation in working memory of planned chess positions reflects the characteristics of actual chess positions and allows chess players to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of these positions and to accurately evaluate and analyze them. Ericsson and Oliver(1984; Ericsson Staszewski, 1989) proposed that the retrieval structures for chess position in memory corresponds to an actual chess board which allows access to each of the board's 64 squares. A chess position is represented as an integrated hierarchical structure relating the different pieces to each other, and all pieces are associated with their corresponding locations. Three kinds of evidence, discussed below, support the claims for such a retrieval structure. First, skilled chess players automatically encode the position of a piece. Second, for skilled players the location of a piece constitutes an effective retrieval cue. Third, experts are able to mentally manipulate and update their memory representation of the chess board.

In the laboratory a chess position is typically represented visually by chess pieces on a board or as a diagram, but it is possible to convey the same information as a list of all the pieces with their respective locations on the chess board. Saariluoma (1989, Exp. 2) found that after listening to a reading of a list of pieces with their locations in a regular chess position, chess masters were able to recall the position almost perfectly. Less skilled players were somewhat less accurate, recalling around 90% of the presented pieces. When the list of pieces was presented at a faster rate(2 s/piece), of the list of pieces accuracy of recall decreased, but chess masters were still 80-90% accurate. Saariluoma (1989, Exp. 1) found that recall was higher for ordered lists in which all chess pieces of the same color were presented together than for lists that presented pieces in a completely random order. With this type of presentation Saariluoma (1989) found that skilled chess players were able to encode and recall randomly arranged chess pieces and that the level of recall was closely related to chess skill.

Random chess positions provide particularly strong evidence that the ability to encode individual chess pieces into the retrieval structure is an acquired skill. At the same time several findings show that meaningful relations between chess pieces are also encoded and that integrated representations are formed for regular chess positions, but not for random positions. Recall of regular game positions is always much more accurate than recall of random positions. In one condition skilled chess players were presented with four positions, either four regular or four random, and then asked to recall them. These players could still recall the regular game positions well--chess maters' accuracy was around 60% -whereas recall of the random positions was below 10%. This finding suggests that meaningful chess positions can be integrated into distinct structures whereas random positions cannot.

A retrieval structure should also allow skilled players to rapidly retrieve select information in response to presented cues, in this case cues specifying a location on the chessboard. Ericsson and Oliver (1984: Ericsson & Staszewski. 1989) had a chess master memorize two different chess positions which required around 20 s of total study time. They then presented this subject with a cue specifying which one of the two positions and its particular location (square) on the chess board. The subiect's task was to name the piece in that location or to say "Nothing" if that location was not occupied. This task was repeated for all locations of the two chessboards. In one of the conditions the locations of only one of the chess positions were repeatedly probed. and the speed of retrieval was fast. In another condition the cued chess position alternated unpredictably between the two chess positions, and the resulting retrieval time increased by around 2s.

Ericsson and oliver (1984) also compared retrieval of various types of information from a perceptually available chess position and from a memorized position. When the task was to count up the number of pieces in rows, columns, and other designated areas of the chessboard, the chess master was somewhat faster with a perceptually available position, but most interestingly, the speed of retrieval showed different patterns as a function of the number of squares that had to be considered. When the task was to retrieve the information from memory, retrieval time increased with the number of squares scanned, unlike retrieval time for perceptually available chess positions. Finally, Ericsson and Oliver found that the chess master could very rapidly extract the number of pieces of a given color that attacked a randomly selected square in a memorized position. In sum, these studies show that a chess master holds the information about a given chess position in highly accessible form and can readily produce information relevant to any of the squares upon demand.

The crucial test of a retrieval structure in chess is whether it allows skilled players to accurately represent dynamically changing board positions without external perceptual support. Chess masters must have such an ability, because they are able to play blindfold chess games. In blindfold chess players cannot see the board position and thus have to represent the current chess position in memory. Many master-level players are reported to be able to play blindfolded at close to their normal chess skill Holding, 1985). To examine the ability of a chess master to mentally represent a chess game. Ericsson and Oliver (1984: Ericsson Staszewski. 1989) presented the chess notation for one move on the CRT at a time for unfamiliar chess games without a perceptually available chessboard. After over 40 chess pieces had been moved, the chess master was tested by cued recall of the contents of all 64 squares of the chessboard. The chess master was able to recall information about chess position during the memory test with virtually perfect accuracy. His speed of retrieval from memory during the test was fast and only marginally slower than in another test condition when the current chess position was perceptually available during the presentation of the same set of questions.

In a series of studies with chess players at several different levels of skill, Saariluoma (1991b) presented the moves of actual chess games auditorily at the rate of one moved piece every 2 s and tested recall of the generated position after 30 and 50 pieces had been moved. Chess masters' recall was virtually perfect, chess experts' recall deteriorated with increased numbers of moves to around 40%, and novices were totally unable to perform the task. Saariluoma (1991b, Exp. 7) showed that under self-paced conditions of study a grand master could maintain 10 simultaneously presented blindfold chess games virtually without error. Chess masters and chess experts could also perform this task, but their accuracy of recall was reduced as a function of their level of skill.

In a couple of experiments Saariluoma (1991b) attempted to determine how chess positions are stored in working memory while subjects mentally construct the current chess position from a sequence of verbally presented moves. Concurrent articulatory suppression had no effect, a finding that ruled out the articulatory loop for storage. Concurrent imagery tasks degraded performance, but performance of the imagery tasks and other attention-demanding tasks during a pause in the presentation of moves had no effect. These results clearly implicate LT-WM in the storage of chess positions.

Research on planning and memory of chess positions offers some of the most compelling evidence for LT-WM. Saarilouma's (1991b)demonstration that a grand master could keep ten different games in during blind-fold chess is remarkable. However, George Koltanowski(1985)have several times played blind-fold chess against thirty or more opponents, where he won most of the games and the rest of games resulted in a draw. The achievements of grand masters in chess reflect memory and other types of skills acquired over ten years of deliberate practice(See Ericsson et al., 1993, for a review) and playing blind-fold chess against many opponents requires the acquisition of additional specialized skill (Koltanowski, 1985).

### 14. Problem Solving in Knowledge-Rich Domains

We conclude our review with activities experts perform to construct integrated representations in memory of a design, computer program, or text. In most of these cases individuals base their constructions on a very large body of relevant knowledge. Because of vast differences in the knowledge available to each individual, research on the design of computer programs, complex social problem solving, and composition of texts has predominantly focused on structural differences in novices' and experts' organization of cognitive processes. cross these three very different task domains, remarkably consistent differences between experts and novices have been found. Not surprisingly, novices tend to start working on a computer program or text without much, if any, planning and preparation. This is most striking for novice writers, who write their texts as a sequence of ideas generated from memory using the provided title and their most recently generated idea as cues. Bereiter and Scardamalia(1987) presented a large body of evidence showing that novice writers produce their texts from repeated probing of memory (knowledge telling)without any prior attempt to reorganize and transform this knowledge for the reader. In contrast, all types of experts tend to spend a substantial amount of time reviewing the problem, considering constraints, and decomposing the problem into a sequence of subproblems that can be solved independently or with minimal interaction.

Basically, the solution of a complex design problem involves mapping in detail the interactions between various parts of the design product. In a computer program, for example, all modules must use the same data representation, and the calculations of certain modules must be passed to other modules. Experts in software design generate complete models of the program at increasing levels of specificity before starting to produce the solution, that is, actually writing the code for the program (Jeffries, Turner, Polson, Atwood, 1981). According to Jeffries et al. (1981), this design process is guided by design schemas available in experts'LTM. In a simpler task studied by Byrne(1977), skilled subjects generated a series of three-course meals for the same guests. In generating the components of the main and second courses, subjects systematically started with the type of protein or meat and then decided on the starch and vegetables, as a sequence that would facilitate the coordination of these components. Byrne (1977) even found that subjects would frequently generate the courses out of order and start with the main and second courses to make the selection of a coordinated first course easier. In another kind of problem-solving experiment, Voss, Greene, Post, and Penner(1983)asked different types of experts and novices to describe how the Soviet Union could increase its agricultural production. Experts on the Soviet Union tended to begin by outlining the history of previous attempts to solve this problem and explored general solutions to increasing depths of specificity in a hierarchical manner. The hierarchical approach allowed experts to consider the general problem of capital investment and its observable implications for more specific problems, such as lack of repair parts and fertilizer. The novices, on the other hand, tended to enumerate these surface problems as separate solutions. Domain-specific knowledge about the Soviet Union was found to be critical, and expert political scientists without that knowledge were able to generate only the abstract issues without being able to proceed to detailed solutions. Experts in subjects outside of political science, such as chemistry, tended to resemble novices in both the content and structure of their solutions.

In contrast to the experts on the Soviet Union, expert writers are frequently not experts on the topics they are writing about. From thinking-aloud studies of writing, Hayes and Flower (1980) demonstrated that experienced writers tend to start by generating ideas and content and spend considerable time organizing this content before beginning to write. Hence, it appears that the experienced writers construct a well-formed organization for their ideas, whereas the domain-specific experts are able to draw on pre-existing cognitive structures.

The composition processes of serious poets and control subjects in an early think-aloud study by Patrick (1935) are similar in structure to those of expert and novice writers. Patrick found that the first phase of writing a poem was dominated by the generation of possible themes, ideas, and images, although she described this phase by the changes in ideas and themes and stressed the non-cumulative character of subjects' thoughts. As a theme emerged, the subjects started writing lines of the poems and toward the end of their work were occupied mostly with revisions or editing.

In summary, the results from analyses of experts' cognitive processes in tasks requiring extensive retrieval tell us something about the role of memory. Through the initial planning and design activity, the expert is able to hierarchically decompose the problem or product into subproblems or subactivities (Simon, 1973). In this way the expert simplifies the actual production of the solution or product, which would be taxing to working memory, and limits this task to a succession of subproblems.

If subiects are to be able to focus their processing resources on a given subproblem, the hierarchically organized solution plan has to be available somewhere. Although few studies have tried to assess empirically where and how the solution plan is stored, several sources of evidence point to storage in LTM. A rich and organized knowledge structure appears to be a prerequisite for generation of a solution plan. The evidence on skilled memory previously reviewed implies that such a knowledge structure would be highly appropriate for rapid storage and efficient retrieval of information.

### 15. Summary

The literature on expert problem-solving contains ample evidence for the operation of a LT- WM. First. in all the areas we have reviewed here--mental calculation. everyday activities. medicine. chess, and knowledge-rich domains--it is apparent that part of being a skilled problemsolver is to possess exceptional memory skills. These memory skills are always highly specific to the domain and can be acquired only through extended practice. They cannot be based on temporary storage in ST- WM because many of the tasks discussed require much greater storage capacity than is available in STM. and because the effects of interference would make storage in STM too unreliable. Furthermore, ample evidence exists (restaurant orders, medical diagnoses, chess) for good LTM after performance of a skilled task.

We have also found a great deal of specific information about the retrieval structures that make expert performance possible in these domains. Experienced mental calculators develop special mnemonic techniques to store the information about a problem and the intermediate results that must be kept available during the course of calculation, whereas intermediate results requiring briefer periods of storage can be distinguished by recency. The retrieval structure of a waiter who memorized dinner orders was studied in some detail and found to be an efficient ad hoc schema, closely adapted to the demands imposed by the particular restaurant menu he had to deal with. The schemas used to organize and remember information in medical diagnosis. various design tasks. and writing appear similar. although the characteristics of LT-WM in those who are expert in these activities have not yet been studied as closely. The retrieval structures in chess, on the other hand, their use by experts, and their acquisition are documented in great detail.

### 16. General Summary and Discussion

We have reviewed evidence on working memory and memory performance in a wide range of skilled activities: acquired memory skill in STM tasks such as the digit span, memory in skilled readers, and memory in expert performers in several domains such as mental calculation, medicine and chess. Individuals in all of these areas demonstrate an increased working memory capacity that is restricted to a certain type of information and specific type of activity. Traditionally investigators have focused on a single type of general activity, such as reading, where it would have been plausible that individual differences reflect basic differences in working-memory capacity for that specific domain. However, a comprehensive theory of human performance and memory should provide a uniform and general account of memory phenomena across all types of domains.

A common feature of superior memory performance and increased working memory capacity is that they are restricted to skilled activities. It is generally agreed that in order to attain skilled performance, individuals acquire domain-specific knowledge, procedures, and various perceptual- motor skills. Our central claim is that in addition, they acquire domain-specific skills to expand working memory capacity by developing methods for storing information in LTM in accessible form. We have thus extended Chase and Ericsson's (1982; Ericsson, 1985; Ericsson & Staszewski, 1989) Skilled Memory Theory beyond the acquisition of exceptional memory to account for the increased capacity of working memory in skilled performance.

To meet the particular demands for working memory in a given skilled activity, subjects acquire encoding methods and retrieval structures that allow efficient storage and retrieval from LTM. In the same manner that skilled subjects acquire relevant knowledge of the demands of an activity and develop efficient procedures for completing a task, they also refine methods for encoding information in LTM. The structures that are generated to represent information, guarantee accessibility with respect to specific future retrieval demands. Retrieval demands differ greatly among different activities. Some tasks, like mental abacus calculation, require rapid and frequent updating of digits in a sum, and there is no need to secure extended storage of previous intermediate sums or results. At the other extreme, text comprehension demands extended storage of the constructed representation of the text,where information relevant to the remainder of the text must remain accessible for integration and storage to continue. LT-WM is therefore closely tailored to the demands of a specific activity and is an integrated, inseparable part of the skill in performing the activity.

Our proposal for working memory is superior in several respects to the traditional accounts based only on transient storage in STM. First, our proposal both accounts for the severe constraints on working memory capacity in unfamiliar tasks and explains how working memory can be extended by the acquisition of LT-WM in skilled activities. Second, it goes beyond the description of working memory in normal cognitive activities and explains the ability of subjects skilled in particular activities to cope with interruptions and then successfully resume their activities. Furthermore, the same mechanisms involved in extended working memory also account for memory about an activity once it is completed. Hence, our proposal offers a general description of the function and structure of memory in cognitive activities. À broad range of activities, including skilled activities, and a large set of phenomena and empirical results are subsumed under this framework. We conclude with a brief discussion of these points and some general implications.

### 17. Constraints on Working Memory Capacity

Any viable model of working memory has to account for the severe problems of reliably maintaining information in accessible form during cognitive processes. Furthermore, the model must reconcile estimates of working memory capacity with other independent estimates of memory storage capacity from specially designed tests of STM and LTM. In particular, any proposed model needs to be consistent with the large body of research on mechanisms and limits uncovered during a century of study of human memory in the laboratory.

Our theory of working memory is consistent with the traditional theories of human memory (see, Cowan, 1988, and Estes, 1988, for recent reviews) in that it incorporates previously proposed mechanisms and storage types. Our central claim is that under restricted circumstances subjects can extend traditional ST-WM by means of cue-based access of information stored in LTM, the LT-WM.

The mechanisms for storage in and retrieval from LTM rely on generally accepted associative principles of human memory.

In the introduction to this paper we reviewed some arguments based on estimates from laboratory studies that storage in LTM is too slow and unreliable to store information efficiently. We then reviewed an extensive body of results showing that memory experts and other experts can reliably store in LTM information that is relevant to representative activities in their domains of expertise. Concerns were raised about subjects' ability to successfully anticipate future retrieval demands and hence about their ability to select and index information so that they could reliably access it later. In skilled activities and when subjects have had extensive experience with the task demands and acquired stable procedures for completing the task, they can foresee retrieval demands and develop memory skills to index relevant information with retrieval structures.

We described the memory skills of LT-WM for many different activities and supported the claim that attainment of these skills requires many years of practice. Furthermore, the domain-specific memory skills and LT-WM we have considered enable us to understand transient storage in attention and STM in a new light.

Our proposal gives a parsimonious account of findings that have been problematic for the standard account of ST-WM. Many investigators, in particular Broadbent (1975), have argued that G. A. Miller's (1956) assessment of the capacity of STM reflects a maximum (correct performance on 50% of trials on a pure memory task) and that the amount of information that can be reliably stored in STM is much lower, around three or four chunks. Within the context of complex cognitive activities such as problem solving and decision making, the reliable working capacity of ST-WM(measured by a number of independent chunks) is likely to be even lower. Similarly we believe that several studies of subjects'maximal STM capacity in specially designed memory tasks overestimate the reliable capacity of STM during normal task-oriented processing. We also believe that this capacity is at least in part due to special strategies such as active rehearsal, which are not habitually used in complex cognitive processing. Nevertheless, LT-WM makes cognitive processing possible even if the lower estimates of the reliable capacity of ST-WM are true.

Our model is consistent with Baddeley's(1986) proposal for an independent subsystem for rehearsal, that is, the articulatory loop. The evidence for a visual-spatial scratch pad that allows for domain-general storage of spatial information is presently less clear. The reported evidence for storage in the visual-spatial scratch pad and the observed interference from concurrent visual-spatial tasks may reflect acquirêd domain-specific storage. The research reviewed here on digit-span experts and individuals playing blind-folded chess suggests that LT-WM with retrieval structures based on spatial cues are used.

The mechanisms of LT-WM that we have developed are consistent with the general recency effect discussed by Baddeley (1986; Baddeley Hitch, 1993)and the implications for working memory of the temporal separation in the Brown-Peterson paradigm discussed by Walter Schneider and Detweiler(1987). Although a more general discussion of current issues in research on STM (Crowder, 1993; Shifrin, 1993) falls outside the scope of this paper, we believe that our proposal for LT-WM provides concepts and mechanisms that will be relevant to some of the controversies concerning storage in LTM in laboratory tasks designed to study only STM.

Although our model of working memory conforms to all the basic constraints on human information processing, it asserts that subjects can acquire skill in the use of LTM and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations of STM for specific domains and tasks. Our proposal does not abolish constraints on working memory; it merely substitutes new constraints on rapid storage in and efficient retrieval from LT-WM for the old constraints on ST-WM.

### 18. The Scope of Relevant Observations for Working Memory

The prevailing conception of working memory as based solely on transient storage in STM is appealing because it is simple. According to this view, a limited number of elements are available in STM during a given state of a cognitive process(see Figure 4). As the cognitive processes unfold, the elements in STM change, but the elements of a given state in STM are sufficient to characterize that state, and investigators have therefore disregarded the subjects' prior processing history. Models based on this prevailing conception typically allow for storage in LTM; but as we noted in the introduction, storage in LTM of the traces of the processes is considered unreliable (described by probabilistic mechanisms). Moreover, storage in LTM is quite limited, at least in many laboratory tasks. Early models (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968) had dual and separate representations of elements in STM and LTM, whereas other theories (D. A. Norman, 1968), especially more recently (Shiffrin Walter Schneider, 1977, Anderson, 1983) propose a more uniform representation, in which elements in STM refer to the activated elements in LTM. In the latter type of model, new associates of an item stored in LTM during cognitive processing should be accessible during subsequent processing.

We have shown that these models of STM are unable to account for subjects' ability to cope with relatively long disruptions of their skilled activities. Furthermore, we have reviewed evidence for accurate and extensive storage of information in LTM that was accessible for controlled retrieval after completion of subjects' tasks. Hence the best evidence for LT-WM comes not from findings about normal processing, but from those for performance under unusual circumstances, such as interruptions imposed by switching between different tasks, by memory testing during processing, and by memory performance after processing has been completed.

One of the benefits of our proposal for LT-WM is that it may account for a much broader range of observations than usual within a single model of concurrent processing. At the same time it necessitates more complicated theories of working memory to describe encoding and storage in LTM with generated associations to relevant retrieval structures. To accurately describe a state in a cognitive process, it will be necessary to specify not only the activated elements in STM but also the generated knowledge structures in LTM. Complete processing models of skilled performance must describe in detail the retrieval cues maintained in ST-WM as well as the generated encodings stored in LTM along with temporal information about when they were stored. Only with such descriptions can investigators fully model the effects of proactive and retroactive interference and the methods subjects acquire to counteract these effects by more extensive and elaborate encodings.

The nature of LT-WM described in our proposal raises issues very different from those studied within the framework of ST-WM. Individual differences in the capacity of working memory are not fundamentally fixed and unchangeable. Instead, they are deliberately acquired. But how? And how can they can be assessed for different domains and tasks? How can instructional procedures be used in remediation? LT-WM for tasks in a given domain of activity is an integrated part of skilled performance. It is clear that our analyses of skilled performance must probe deeply into the organization of knowledge and its encoding and retrieval processes if they are to fully describe the operation of LT-WM. Only if we are willing to fully describe and dissect complex cognitive skills will we ever ascertain the real limits of cognition and create a theoretical framework for working memory that encompasses the full range and complexity of cognitive processes.
