Roger McCann tries to identify some of the attributes of knowledge.

"Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods" – Albert Einstein

Knowledge is a strange concept. It is used as though its meaning were as well understood as ‘dog'. Even though dogs come in innumerable sizes, shapes, and colors, there is rarely disagreement as to whether something is, or is not, a dog. The same is not true for knowledge. In common usage, ‘knowledge' can be both transient（It is no longer tenable that the Earth is flat）and eternal（In Euclidean geometry the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°); both irrational（‘Jesus is both God and human'）and rational（the contents of Euclid's Elements); both confusing（the interdependency of life-forms in nature）and clarifying（Kepler's laws of planetary motion). Perhaps a suitable definition of knowledge would remove these ambiguities.

In common usage, knowledge is often defined as a familiarity with something, such as facts, information, or skills acquired through thought or experience. However, there is no absolutely accepted philosophical definition of knowledge. In Plato's dialogue Theaetetus（c.369 BCE), Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of knowledge：knowledge is perception, knowledge is true belief, and knowledge is justified true belief. Philosophers have never been entirely satisfied with any of them. Bertrand Russell（1872-1970）summarizes the problem with defining knowledge in his ‘Theory of Knowledge'（1913)："at first sight it might be thought that knowledge might be defined as belief which is in agreement with the facts. The trouble is that no one knows what a belief is, no one knows what a fact is, and no one knows what sort of agreement between them would make a belief true."

In any system of thought there are undefined concepts, called ‘primitive notions', that are formulated by appealing to intuition or experience, and are thought to need no further justification. Since at least 2,500 years of trying has failed to produce a satisfactory definition of knowledge, let us assume that knowledge is a primitive notion. This does not mean that knowledge is necessarily an amorphous concept：a primitive notion can often be at least partially described by listing some of its attributes, such as Islam's 99 names of Allah.

The main purpose of this article is to present examples that will help identify, or rule out, attributes of knowledge. These examples are drawn mainly from mathematics and physics. I do not claim that the attributes I propose are definitely attributes of knowledge, but I do claim that they are plausible attributes of knowledge. The reader is left to decide how plausible. If they are found to be implausible, then that would itself suggest other attributes of knowledge. Along the way we will see that ‘knowledge' as proposed by certain seventeenth century philosophers was made untenable by a twentieth century mathematician-logician, and that the supposed ‘knowledge' of Aristotle（384-322 BCE）was made untenable by scientists in the sixteenth century. In addition, we will consider two fundamental questions about knowledge：(1）Does knowledge exist? and, if knowledge does exist,（2）What are possible sources of knowledge?

We'll begin by considering the latter question.

罗杰·麦肯试图探讨知识的一些属性。

任何试图将自己设定为真理和知识裁判的人，都会被神灵的笑声所击沉。—— 阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦

知识是一个奇特的概念。人们使用它时，似乎它的意义像「狗」一样明了。尽管狗有无数种大小、形状和颜色，但很少有人会对某物是否是狗产生分歧。对于知识就没有这么简单了。在日常用语中，「知识」既可以是暂时的（例如，地球是平的这一观点已经不再成立），也可以是永恒的（在欧几里得几何中，三角形内角之和为 180°）；既可以是非理性的（例如，耶稣既是神又是人），也可以是理性的（例如，欧几里得《几何原本》的内容）；既可以是令人困惑的（例如，自然界中生命形式的相互依存性），也可以是澄清性的（例如，开普勒的行星运动定律）。或许一个合适的知识定义能够消除这些模糊性。

在日常用语中，知识通常被定义为对某事物的熟悉，例如通过思考或经验获得的事实、信息或技能。然而，并没有一个被普遍接受的哲学定义。在柏拉图的对话《泰阿泰德篇》(约公元前 369 年）中，苏格拉底和泰阿泰德讨论了知识的三种定义：知识是感知，知识是真信仰，知识是有正当理由的真信仰。哲学家们从未对任何一种定义完全满意。伯特兰·罗素（1872-1970）在他的《知识论》(1913）中总结了定义知识的问题：「乍一看，人们可能认为知识可以被定义为与事实相一致的信仰。问题在于，没有人确切知道什么是信仰，没有人确切知道什么是事实，也没有人确切知道它们之间的何种一致会使信仰成为真理。」

在任何思想体系中，总有一些未定义的概念，我们称之为「原始概念」。这些概念通过直觉或经验形成，不需要进一步的证明。过去至少 2500 年里，人们一直无法给知识下一个令人满意的定义，因此我们可以假设知识是一种原始概念。这并不意味着知识是一个模糊的概念：原始概念通常可以通过列出其一些属性来部分描述，比如伊斯兰教中真主的 99 个名称。

本文的主要目的是通过一些例子来帮助识别或排除知识的属性。这些例子大多来自数学和物理。我并不声称这些属性一定是知识的属性，但我认为它们是合理的知识属性。读者可以自行判断这些属性的合理性。如果它们被认为不合理，这本身也会提示我们去寻找其他属性。在此过程中，我们会发现，某些十七世纪哲学家提出的「知识」被二十世纪的数学家和逻辑学家否定了，而亚里士多德（公元前 384-322 年）的「知识」被十六世纪的科学家驳斥了。此外，我们还会讨论两个关于知识的基本问题：1）知识是否存在？如果存在，2）知识可能的来源是什么？

我们将从第二个问题开始。

### 01. Sources of Knowledge

In the West, knowledge has often been identified as the result of rational thought – the truth of which idea has been disputed by philosophers for centuries. Some philosophers, rationalists such as Baruch Spinoza（1632-1677）and Gottfried Leibniz（1646-1716), argued that one can deduce all possible knowledge from a suitable set of axioms; other philosophers, empiricists such as John Locke（1632-1704）and David Hume（1711-1776), argued that knowledge comes solely from experience of the world. Most philosophers fall in the gap between these two extremes, by arguing that both reason and experience are necessary for knowledge. In short, a major portion of Western philosophy is based on the premise that knowledge follows either from rational thought, experience, or from a combination of the two.

But these are not the only possible sources of knowledge. Muslims believe that Muhammad（c.570-c.632）received the Koran by divine revelation. Thomas Aquinas（1226-1274）also considered divine revelation to be a source of knowledge, in his case for the Bible. In Zen Buddhism, the primary purpose of a koan（a paradoxical question, such as ‘What is the sound of one hand clapping?'）is to exhaust the rational intellect, thereby leaving the mind open for an intuitive experience, and with it a type of knowledge. The Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanajan（1887-1920）credited his mathematical accomplishments to his family goddess, while his colleague and collaborator G.H. Hardy（1877-1947）claimed they were achieved by other means, including intuition. Anyone who doubts that divine revelation or intuition can be a possible source of knowledge should consider the work of Ramanajan.

However, divine revelation and intuition suffer from many of the same problems, among which are：(1）What is divine revelation or intuitive knowledge to some may be utter nonsense to others;（2）Divine revelation and intuition frequently conflict with other divine revelations and intuitions;（3）Divine revelation and intuition are often influenced by tradition, conventional wisdom, or other biases;（4）Divine revelation and intuition can conflict with rational thought or experience; and（5）Divine revelation and intuition cannot be replicated or verified.

There are also innumerable other methods people have used to gain ‘knowledge'; for example, scapulimancy（predicting the future by reading cracks on heated shoulder bones). Before we disparage so-called ‘primitive' societies for such methods, we need to remember that astrological forecasts still appear in many Western newspapers, that phrenology has had various levels of acceptance during its very recent history, and that both Ouija Boards and Tarot cards are readily available, even at Walmart and Amazon. Such methods are well documented to be even more unreliable than the other mentioned sources of knowledge, and will not be considered further.

There is yet another, seldom recognized, source of ‘knowledge', namely legislation. Can knowledge be legislated? The question may seem absurd, but attempts have been made to legislate knowledge. For example, in 1897, the Indiana House of Representatives unanimously passed a Bill to legislate a value for pi. Correcting a possible transcript error in the records gives pi a value of 9.2376…. Fortunately, the Indiana Senate voted to postpone consideration of the Bill, and it never became law.（See Petr Beckmann's book, A History of π.）What would have happened if the Bill had been enacted is anybody's guess. But pi is what it is. No legislation, presidential decree, royal edict, fatwah, papal bull, or any other human proclamation, can make it otherwise. I propose that this is an attribute of knowledge in general. That is, knowledge cannot be established solely by human proclamation.

On this theme, since the early 1900s there have been numerous attempts in the United States to ban the teaching of evolution and require the teaching of creation science. A law advancing the latter was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987 because the court considered the law an attempt to advance a particular religion. During the hearing, numerous scientists and scientific organizations filed amicus briefs describing creation science as being composed of religious tenets. In short, the battle was over whether ‘knowledge' from divine revelation supersedes ‘knowledge' from experience and rational thought. Thus the age-old philosophical debate over the essence of knowledge has in some quarters degenerated into a legal issue. Shakespeare's comment, "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers" from Henry VI, Part 2, was not made by a character seeking knowledge, but it could have been.

The above description of possible sources of knowledge confirms Einstein's observation about gods' laughter shipwrecking whoever undertakes to be a judge of knowledge. Nonetheless, we will now follow philosophical tradition, and focus on rational thought and experience as possible sources of knowledge.

知识的来源

在西方，知识常常被视为理性思考的结果 —— 这个观点已经被哲学家们争论了几个世纪。一些理性主义哲学家，如 Baruch Spinoza（1632-1677）和 Gottfried Leibniz（1646-1716），认为所有知识都可以从一组合适的公理中推导出来；而经验主义哲学家，如 John Locke（1632-1704）和 David Hume（1711-1776），则认为知识完全来自于对世界的经验。大多数哲学家介于这两者之间，认为理性和经验都是知识必不可少的。简而言之，西方哲学主要认为知识要么来自理性思考，要么来自经验，或者是两者的结合。

然而，知识的来源不仅限于此。穆斯林相信 Muhammad（约 570 - 约 632）通过神的启示获得了《古兰经》。Thomas Aquinas（1226-1274）也认为神的启示是知识的来源，他的理论主要基于《圣经》。在禅宗佛教中，公案（如‘一只手拍掌的声音是什么？'）的主要目的是让人们摆脱理智的束缚，从而体验直观的感悟，并获得一种特殊的知识。印度数学家 Srinivasa Ramanajan（1887-1920）把他的数学成就归功于他的家族女神，而他的同事 G.H. Hardy（1877-1947）则认为这些成就是通过其他手段如直觉获得的。任何怀疑神的启示或直觉能成为知识来源的人，都应该看看 Ramanajan 的工作。

然而，神圣启示和直觉也存在许多问题，其中包括：1）对某些人来说是神圣启示或直觉知识的东西，对其他人来说可能完全是胡言乱语；2）神圣启示和直觉经常与其他神圣启示和直觉相冲突；3）神圣启示和直觉常常受到传统、常识或其他偏见的影响；4）神圣启示和直觉可能与理性思维或经验相冲突；5）神圣启示和直觉无法复制或验证。

此外，还有无数其他方法被人们用来获取「知识」；例如，肩胛骨占卜法（通过观察加热后肩胛骨上的裂缝来预测未来）。在我们贬低所谓的「原始」社会使用这些方法之前，我们需要记住，占星预测仍然出现在许多西方报纸上，颅相学在其近代历史中曾有过不同程度的接受度，而且通灵板和塔罗牌甚至在沃尔玛和亚马逊上也能轻松买到。这些方法已经被证实比前面提到的知识来源更不可靠，因此不再进一步考虑。

还有一种很少被认可的「知识」来源，那就是立法。可以通过立法来规定知识吗？这个问题似乎很荒谬，但确实有人尝试过。例如，1897 年，印第安纳州众议院一致通过了一项法案，试图通过立法规定 π 的数值。记录中的一个可能的抄写错误使 π 的数值变成了 9.2376……。幸运的是，印第安纳州参议院推迟了对该法案的审议，最终该法案没有成为法律。（参见 Petr Beckmann 的《π 的历史》一书。）如果该法案通过，后果难以预测。但 π 就是 π。没有任何立法、总统令、皇室诏书、宗教法令或教皇诏书可以改变这一点。我认为这是知识的一个属性，即知识不能仅靠人类的公告来确定。

关于这个话题，自 20 世纪初以来，美国多次尝试禁止进化论教学并要求教授创造科学。1987 年，美国最高法院裁定一项推动创造科学的法律违宪，因为法院认为该法律试图推进特定宗教。在听证会上，许多科学家和科学组织提交了法庭之友意见书，指出创造科学是由宗教教义组成的。简而言之，这场争论的核心在于「知识」是来自神圣启示还是经验和理性思考。因此，这一古老的关于知识本质的哲学辩论在某些情况下已经变成了法律问题。莎士比亚在《亨利六世》第二部分中的评论，「我们首先要做的，就是杀掉所有的律师」，并不是由一个寻求知识的人物说的，但它本可以是。

对可能知识来源的上述讨论印证了爱因斯坦的观点：神明的笑声会让那些试图评判知识的人遭遇船难。尽管如此，我们还是要遵循哲学传统，探讨理性思维和经验作为知识来源的可能性。

### 02. Rational Thought

Rational thought has been used to justify concepts that some find ludicrous（e.g., the existence – or non-existence – of God）or abhorrent（e.g., principles of eugenics as interpreted by the Nazis). Nonetheless, many people believe that a statement such as ‘All knowledge comes from rational thought', can be established as either true or false by logical means. Unfortunately, in 1931 Kurt Gödel（1906-1978）proved his Incompleteness Theorem, which says that within all but the most trivial logical systems capable of doing arithmetic, statements exist that are neither provable nor disprovable using the axioms that define the system. I can conceive of no reasonable attribute of knowledge that would keep the Incompleteness Theorem from being knowledge.

Rational thought was used to prove the Incompleteness Theorem, but the Theorem itself is independent of rational thought, just as an arch is independent of the centering used to construct it. Therefore, we will say that the Incompleteness Theorem is absolute knowledge. In addition, there is no apparent experience that would yield the Incompleteness Theorem. I propose therefore that the Incompleteness Theorem is absolute knowledge that cannot be attained by experience. Consequently, ‘Knowledge exists', ‘Some knowledge is absolute' and ‘Some knowledge cannot be attained from experience' are also plausible attributes of knowledge.

Was the Incompleteness Theorem knowledge before Gödel proved it? This question can be formulated more generally as, Does knowledge exist independently and is merely discovered, or do humans create knowledge? I cannot give a definitive answer to this question, but I can give a partial answer.

Prime numbers are widely used to secure information, such as bank card transactions and email accounts. Thus, there are few whose lives are not affected daily by prime numbers. I can conceive of no reasonable attribute of knowledge that would exclude knowing whether a number is prime from being knowledge. Euclid（323-283 BCE）is credited with an elegant proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers. So suppose N denotes the largest known prime number – which as of early last year has over 17.4 million digits. The next prime number larger than N exists according to Euclid's proof, and so awaits discovery. Thus, at least some knowledge is discovered and not created. This is another plausible attribute of knowledge.

Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Jane Marple, and other fictional detectives deceptively lead us to believe that rational thought can resolve the most complex enigmas. In reality, many issues may be too complex for purely rational resolution, especially philosophical or religious issues. Rational arguments both for and against concepts such as free will or the existence of God abound – thereby creating a prima facie case against rational thought being a reliable source of knowledge. But this may be only an illusion due to improper application of rationality. A valid rational argument is based on a set of postulates. Unfortunately, many so-called ‘rational arguments' are based upon ill-defined, if not undefined, postulates. This allows ‘rational arguments' to validate both a concept and a conflicting concept, thereby creating an absurd situation in which arguments are simultaneously both rational and irrational! Without clearly knowing the postulates upon which it is based, a ‘rational argument' can be little more than intimidation by strength of personality or erudition, or its conclusion simply a statement with superficial appeal. An example of the former is Aristotle's influence suppressing for roughly seventeen hundred years the notion of a sun-centered solar system, proposed by Aristarchus of Samos in c.270 BCE. Political slogans illustrate the latter.

However, it also needs to be noted that knowledge attained by rational argument is relative to a set of postulates, and so not absolute. Geometry provides a good example of this.

Figure: Can we say we know what our senses tell us?

Euclidean geometry is based on five postulates. The Fifth Postulate, called ‘the Parallel Postulate', is that there is exactly one straight line that can be drawn through a point not on a given line which will be parallel to the given line. If the phrase ‘there is exactly one straight line' in the Fifth Postulate is replaced by ‘there exists no straight line', or by ‘there exist at least two straight lines', Euclid's first four postulates together with one of these new postulates describe an equally valid ‘non-Euclidean' geometry. These replacements were done around 1830 by Janos Bolyai（1775-1856）and Nicolai Lobachevsky（1792-1856). Pythagoras's Theorem is valid in Euclidean geometry, but is not valid in the non-Euclidean geometries. Thus, if Pythagoras's Theorem is knowledge, it is knowledge relative to the postulates of Euclidean geometry and not relative to the postulates of non-Euclidean geometries. However, not accepting Pythagoras's Theorem as knowledge would ignore the fundamental fact that the Theorem is utilized in everyday engineering and construction. Few would consider this acceptable. Consequently, ‘Some knowledge comes from rational thought' and ‘Some knowledge is relative' are both plausible attributes of knowledge.

A major problem with a rational argument is the appropriateness of the postulates on which the argument is based. The appropriateness of geometric postulates is sometimes easy to resolve. Euclidean geometry is appropriate for calculations on an everyday scale, while non-Euclidean geometries are appropriate for calculations on a large scale where general relativity applies, such as in cosmology and celestial mechanics. Unfortunately, it is sometimes impossible to resolve the appropriateness of postulates, as is the case in the debate over free will. People who believe the postulate that everything that happens is determined by physical laws believe that free will does not exist; while people who believe the postulate that mind can make choices independent of the influence of physical law believe that free will does exist. Each argument is valid only relative to its own postulates.

One might try to avoid the problem of appropriate postulates by saying that the conclusion of any rational argument is knowledge relative to the associated postulates. But if we do say this, what do we do with cases in which the postulates are nonsensical, contradictory, or paradoxical? We surely do not want to consider results based on such postulates as knowledge. Thus, we would need an attribute of knowledge that precludes inappropriate postulates. Unfortunately, I have no candidate.

Before we leave this discussion of rational thought, please note that there is no universal agreement as to what ‘rational thought' is. The technique of reductio ad absurdum – a method of indirectly proving a proposition by assuming its negation to be true, and showing that this leads to a contradiction – has been used by philosophers from the fifth century BCE onward, with Heraclitus（c.535-c.475 BCE）and Hegel（1770-1831）being notable exceptions. The discovery of contradictions at the apparent foundations of mathematics around the beginning of the twentieth century, such as Russell's Paradox, led a few philosophers, such as Graham Priest（1948-）to develop logic systems in which some statements can be both true and false. Consequently, what is knowledge in a traditional logical system may not be knowledge relative to one of these other logic systems, and vice versa. Even though these alternative logic systems are not widely accepted, they nevertheless complicate the concept of ‘rational thought'.

理性思维

理性思维曾被用来证明一些令人难以置信（如上帝的存在或不存在）或令人厌恶的概念（如纳粹对优生学的解释）。尽管如此，许多人仍然相信「所有知识都来自理性思维」这样的说法可以通过逻辑手段验证。遗憾的是，1931 年 Kurt Gödel（1906-1978）证明了他的「不完备定理」，该定理指出，在所有非琐碎的逻辑系统中，存在一些既无法证明也无法反驳的陈述。我无法设想任何知识属性会排除不完备定理作为知识的一部分。

虽然不完备定理是通过理性思维证明的，但该定理本身独立于理性思维，就像拱门独立于建造它的支架一样。因此，我们可以说不完备定理是绝对知识。此外，没有任何经验可以得出不完备定理。因此，我认为不完备定理是无法通过经验获得的绝对知识。因此，「知识存在」，「某些知识是绝对的」和「某些知识无法通过经验获得」也是知识的合理属性。

在 Gödel 证明不完备定理之前，人们是否已经知道这一知识？这个问题可以更普遍地表述为：知识是独立存在并被发现的，还是由人类创造的？对此问题我无法给出确切答案，但可以提供部分见解。

质数广泛应用于信息安全领域，例如银行卡交易和电子邮件账户的保护。因此，几乎每个人的生活都受到质数的影响。我认为，将判断一个数是否为质数排除在知识之外是没有道理的。Euclid（公元前 323-283）被认为提出了一个优雅的证明，证明了质数是无限的。假设 N 表示已知的最大质数，截至去年初，这个质数有超过 1740 万位数。根据 Euclid 的证明，N 之后的下一个更大的质数是存在的，只是等待被发现。因此，至少有一些知识是被发现的，而不是被创造的。这也是知识的一个合理属性。

Sherlock Holmes、Hercule Poirot、Jane Marple 以及其他虚构侦探让我们误以为仅凭理性思维就能解决最复杂的谜题。实际上，许多问题可能复杂到无法仅靠理性解决，特别是哲学或宗教问题。例如，自由意志或上帝存在等概念的理性论证数不胜数，因此乍看之下，理性思维并不是可靠的知识来源。但这可能是由于错误应用理性造成的错觉。一个有效的理性论证需要基于一组明确的假设。不幸的是，许多所谓的「理性论证」基于的是不明确甚至未定义的假设。这使得「理性论证」能够同时验证一个概念及其相反的概念，导致论证既是理性的又是非理性的荒谬情况！如果不明确了解其假设基础，一个「理性论证」可能只是借助个人魅力或知识渊博来进行威慑，或者其结论只是一个表面上看似有理的陈述。一个例子是，亚里士多德的影响力使得阿里斯塔克斯在公元前 270 年左右提出的日心说被压制了近一千七百年。政治口号则是另一个例子。

然而，还需要注意的是，通过理性论证获得的知识是相对于一组假设的，因此并不是绝对的。几何学就是一个很好的例子。

我们能说我们知道我们的感官告诉我们什么吗？

欧几里得几何建立在五条公设之上。第五条公设，被称为「平行公设」，内容是：通过不在已知直线上的一点，且只能画出一条与该已知直线平行的直线。如果将第五条公设中的「且只能画出一条直线」替换为「没有直线」或「至少可以画出两条直线」，那么欧几里得的前四条公设与这些新的公设之一共同描述了一种同样有效的「非欧几里得」几何。大约在 1830 年，Janos Bolyai（1775-1856）和 Nicolai Lobachevsky（1792-1856）提出了这些替换方案。毕达哥拉斯定理在欧几里得几何中是成立的，但在非欧几里得几何中不成立。因此，如果毕达哥拉斯定理是知识，它是基于欧几里得几何的公设，而不是基于非欧几里得几何的公设。然而，如果不接受毕达哥拉斯定理作为知识，就会忽视这样一个基本事实：该定理在日常工程和建筑中被广泛应用。很少有人会认为这是可以接受的。因此，「一些知识来自理性思考」和「一些知识是相对的」都是知识的合理属性。

理性论证的一个主要问题在于，其所依赖的假设是否适当。几何学中的假设有时比较容易解决。例如，欧几里得几何适用于日常生活中的计算，而非欧几里得几何则适用于涉及广义相对论的大尺度计算，如宇宙学和天体力学。然而，有时假设的适当性难以确定，比如在关于自由意志的争论中。认为所有事情都由物理定律决定的人认为自由意志不存在；而认为心灵可以独立于物理定律做出选择的人则认为自由意志存在。每种论证在其自身的假设下都是有效的。

有人可能会试图通过说，任何理性论证的结论都是基于其相关假设的知识来回避适当性的问题。但如果假设是无意义的、矛盾的或自相矛盾的，我们该如何处理呢？显然，我们不会将基于这些假设的结果视为知识。因此，我们需要定义知识的一个属性，以排除不适当的假设。不幸的是，我没有找到合适的候选答案。

在结束关于理性思维的讨论之前，值得注意的是，人们对「理性思维」的定义并没有达成一致。归谬法（reductio ad absurdum）是一种通过假设命题的否定成立并证明其自相矛盾来间接证明命题的方法，自公元前五世纪以来一直被哲学家们使用，但赫拉克利特（约公元前 535 - 约公元前 475）和黑格尔（1770-1831）是少数例外。二十世纪初期，数学基础中出现的矛盾，例如罗素悖论，促使一些哲学家，如 Graham Priest（1948-）发展出一些逻辑系统，在这些系统中某些陈述可以既为真又为假。因此，在传统逻辑系统中被视为知识的东西，在这些新逻辑系统中可能不被视为知识，反之亦然。尽管这些替代逻辑系统尚未被广泛接受，但它们确实让「理性思维」的概念变得更加复杂。

### 03. Experience

Another plausible attribute of knowledge is ‘Some knowledge comes from experience'.

Using the Incompleteness Theorem as an example, we have already concluded that some knowledge does not come from experience. Therefore, it does not seem possible to increase ‘Some' to ‘All' in this attribute. Nonetheless, it is interesting to consider the validity of ‘All knowledge comes solely from experience' from two other points of view.

First, suppose the statement ‘All knowledge comes solely from experience' is true, then this is surely a piece of knowledge. But since it is impossible for us to experience all possible knowledge, experience could not establish this particular piece of knowledge. This reductio ad absurdum seems to prove the opposite, that some knowledge does not come from experience. However, there are two other conclusions possible from this argument：(1）the validity of the statement ‘All knowledge comes solely from experience' is unknowable; or（2）it is true but its truth is incompatible with standard rational thought.（Ironically, Locke, Hume, and others devoted hundreds of pages of rational argument trying to justify the validity of the proposition ‘All knowledge comes solely from experience'.)

Second, since antiquity, rational mathematical arguments have shown that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter（pi）does not depend on the particular circle chosen. Experience obtained by measuring the circumferences and diameters of numerous circles might also lead one to conjecture that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter does not depend on the particular circle chosen. However, it is not possible to establish this solely by experience, due to inesscapable measurement error（no measurement is truly exact), and also to the impossibility of measuring all circles. So if we accept ‘All knowledge comes solely from experience', then an essential fact in mathematics, science and engineering that affects everyday life would not be knowledge. Few would consider this an acceptable conclusion.

Fiure: Euclid taking a measured approach to knowledge

Detractors of experience as a source of knowledge cite deficiencies analogous to those I listed for divine revelation as a source of knowledge. For example, we have all been deceived by experiences. Optical illusions, such as water appearing to flow uphill, are common in amusement parks. Magicians and con-men make their livings by creating deceptive experiences. So not all experiences are reliable. This idea is supported in an extreme sense by the Buddhist concept that ‘all is illusion', and by Western writers such as Edgar Allen Poe（1809-1849), who wrote："All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream."

Another primary difficulty in basing knowledge on experience is that experiences vary from person to person, from culture to culture, and from time to time. For instance, until the beginning of the twentieth century, experience showed that something cannot be in two different states simultaneously. Quantum physics altered that dramatically. The 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Serge Haroche（1944-）and David J. Wineland（1944&-）for work that included experiments that put an ion in two different energy states simultaneously. Thus, what appeared to be knowledge for millennia is no longer knowledge.

The quantum physics example raises a fundamental question：How do we know that future experiences will not negate other current ‘knowledge' attained from experience? Closely related to this question is：How does one know which experiences yield knowledge（if any)?

One might suppose that the answer is ‘experience that is confirmed by another source of knowledge', such as rational thought. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case, as the geocentric model for the cosmos illustrates. The geocentric model – with the Earth at the center of the cosmos and all celestial bodies orbiting it – was the dominant cosmological system of many ancient civilizations. This model was supported by experiences including（1）the stars, the sun, and planets appearing to revolve around the Earth; and（2）the Earth not seeming to move for someone on the Earth, and also by rational thought, as well as divine revelation（e.g., Joshua 10:12, where the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and Psalms 93:1, where the world is described as never moving). Eventually, other experiences and rational arguments, by Nicolaus Copernicus（1473-1543), Tycho Brahe（1546-1601), Galileo Galilei（1564-1642), Johannes Kepler（1571-1630）and others, showed the geocentric model to be untenable for most people. However, this does demonstrate that experience supported by other sources of knowledge does not necessarily yield knowledge. Is there an attribute of knowledge that identifies which experiences do yield knowledge? If so, I do not have even an inkling of what it may be.

经验

另一个对知识合理的解释是「某些知识来自经验」。

以不完备性定理（Incompleteness Theorem）为例，我们已经知道有些知识并非源自经验。因此，认为所有知识都来自经验这一观点似乎是站不住脚的。不过，从另外两个角度探讨「所有知识仅来源于经验」的观点，仍然是很有趣的。

首先，假设「所有知识都仅来自经验」这一说法是正确的，那么这本身就是一种知识。但由于我们无法亲身体验所有可能的知识，经验无法支持这个特定的知识。这种反证法似乎证明了相反的结论，即有些知识并非来自经验。不过，还可以得出另外两种可能的结论：1）「所有知识都仅来自经验」这一说法的有效性是无法确定的；或者：2）虽然这是真的，但它的真实性与标准逻辑思维不一致。（讽刺的是，Locke 和 Hume 等人花费了大量篇幅试图通过理性论证来证明这一命题的有效性。）

其次，自古以来，数学上的理性论证已经表明，圆的周长与直径之比（π）不依赖于具体选择的圆。通过测量许多圆的周长和直径获得的经验也可能使人推测这种比率是恒定的。然而，由于任何测量都不可避免地存在误差（没有测量是完全精确的），并且我们无法测量所有的圆，仅靠经验是无法确定这一点的。因此，如果我们认可「所有知识都仅来自经验」，那么一个影响日常生活的重要数学、科学和工程事实就无法被视为知识。这是大多数人无法接受的结论。

Euclid 采用了一种精确测量的方法来获取知识。

反对经验作为知识来源的人列举了类似于神圣启示作为知识来源的缺陷。例如，在游乐园中很常见的光学错觉，比如水看起来在上坡流动。魔术师和骗子靠制造欺骗性的体验谋生。所以并非所有经验都可靠。这个观点在极端意义上，得到了佛教「万物皆幻」理念和西方作家 Edgar Allen Poe（1809-1849）的支持，他写道：「我们所见或所想的只是梦中之梦。」

另一个基于经验作为知识的主要困难是，经验因人而异，因文化而异，因时间而异。例如，直到 20 世纪初，经验表明某物不能同时处于两种不同状态。量子物理学彻底改变了这一点。2012 年诺贝尔物理学奖授予了 Serge Haroche（1944-）和 David J. Wineland（1944-），他们的工作包括将一个离子同时置于两种不同能量状态的实验。因此，数千年来被认为是知识的东西现在不再被视为知识。

量子物理学的例子提出了一个基本问题：我们如何知道未来的经验不会否定我们当前从经验中获得的「知识」？与这个问题密切相关的是：我们如何知道哪些经验产生知识（如果有的话）？

有人可能会认为，知识的来源是「由其他知识验证的经验」，比如理性思维。然而，事实并非总是如此，地心说模型就是一个例子。地心说模型认为地球是宇宙的中心，所有天体都围绕地球运转，这一观点曾在许多古代文明中占主导地位。这个理论得到了以下几方面的经验支持：1）恒星、太阳和行星看似围绕地球旋转；2）站在地球表面的人感觉不到地球在运动。同时，理性思维和神圣启示（如约书亚记 10:12 中描述的太阳和月亮在天空中停止，诗篇 93:1 中描述的世界恒久不动）也支持这一模型。然而，后来尼古拉·哥白尼（1473-1543)、第谷·布拉赫（1546-1601)、伽利略·伽利莱（1564-1642）和约翰内斯·开普勒（1571-1630）等人的研究和论证表明，地心说模型是站不住脚的。这说明，即使经验得到了其他知识的支持，也不一定能形成真正的知识。那么，有没有一种知识的特性可以帮助我们识别哪些经验能产生知识呢？对此，我毫无头绪。

### Conclusions

We have considered several possible sources of knowledge, none of which have proved entirely satisfactory. However, our examples, mostly based on rational thought and experience, indicate several plausible attributes of knowledge:

(1）Knowledge exists;

(2）Some, but not all, knowledge comes from rational thought;

(3）Some, but not all, knowledge comes from experience;

(4）Some knowledge is absolute, while other knowledge is relative to postulates;

(5）At least some knowledge is discovered and not created; and

(6）Knowledge cannot be established by human proclamation.

We apparently need to develop further attributes to prevent the use of inappropriate postulates in rational thought and to identify which experiences yield knowledge. If these attributes exist, then we can hardly maintain the assumption that knowledge is a primitive notion.

Due to the infinite variety of life and thought provided by different cultures, I doubt the latter attributes exist. However, I fear that as advancing communication technology homogenizes cultures, formulations of such attributes identifying knowledge will appear plausible, and may enable the creation of totalitarian societies, as depicted in the novels Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and 1984. In short, I fear that what passes for knowledge can and will be both created and destroyed. This certainly seems to be a major goal of some political campaigns.

Furthermore, if these latter attributes are found, they would greatly reduce the importance of faith in all its aspects, and generally make life much less interesting and amusing, by removing its diversity. I hope instead that a paraphrase of Mark Twain's observation about religion applies to knowledge：Humankind is the only animal that has the True Knowledge – several of them. If so, a judge of Knowledge is indeed shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods; and hopefully by our laughter as well.

结论

我们探讨了几种可能的知识来源，但没有一种是完全令人满意的。不过，通过理性思维和经验的实例，我们可以总结出几种知识的特性：

1、知识是存在的。

2、有些知识来自理性思维，但不是全部。

3、有些知识来自经验，但不是全部。

4、有些知识是绝对的，而另一些知识是相对的。

5、至少有些知识是被发现的，而不是被创造的。

6、知识不能通过人类的宣布来确立。

我们显然需要发展新的属性，以防止在理性思维中使用不恰当的假设，并识别哪些经验能够产生知识。如果这些属性确实存在，那么我们很难继续认为知识是一个基本概念。

由于不同文化带来了无限多样的生活和思想，我怀疑这些属性是否真的存在。然而，我担心，随着通信技术的发展使文化越来越同质化，识别知识的这些属性可能会显得合理，并可能导致极权社会的出现，就像小说《华氏 451》、《美丽新世界》和《1984》中描绘的那样。简而言之，我担心所谓的知识将会被创造和毁灭。这似乎是一些政治运动的主要目标。

此外，如果这些属性被发现，它们将大大减少信仰在各个方面的重要性，并通过消除多样性使生活变得更加单调和乏味。我更希望的是，马克·吐温关于宗教的观察也适用于知识：人类是唯一拥有「真理」的动物 —— 而且有好几种。如果是这样，知识的评判者确实会被神的笑声所打击；也希望会被我们的笑声所打击。
