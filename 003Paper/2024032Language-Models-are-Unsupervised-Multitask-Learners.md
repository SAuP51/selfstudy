### Abstract

Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.

自然语言处理任务，如问答、机器翻译、阅读理解和摘要等，通常采用在特定任务数据集上进行监督学习（supervised learning）的方法。我们的研究表明，当在一个名为 WebText 的新数据集（包含数百万网页）上进行训练时，语言模型开始在没有任何明确指导的情况下学习这些任务。这种方法被称为零样本学习（zero-shot learning)。

具体来说，当我们向模型提供一篇文档和相关问题时，模型生成的答案在 CoQA 数据集上达到了 55 的 F1 得分。这一成绩在不使用 127,000 多个训练样本的情况下，就能匹配或超过 4 个基准测试系统中的 3 个的表现。这里的基准测试系统是指在该任务上已有的、性能良好的标准模型。

我们发现，语言模型的规模对于零样本任务迁移的成功至关重要。随着模型规模的增加，各项任务的性能呈对数线性方式提升。我们最大的模型 GPT-2（Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2）是一个拥有 15 亿参数的 Transformer 模型。在零样本设置下，它在 8 个测试的语言建模数据集中的 7 个上达到了最先进的结果。然而，该模型在 WebText 数据集上仍然存在欠拟合现象，这意味着模型还有进一步学习和改进的空间。

从 GPT-2 模型生成的文本样本中，我们可以看到这些性能的提升。生成的内容包含连贯的文本段落，显示出模型对语言的深入理解。这些发现为构建新一代语言处理系统指明了一个有前景的方向：让系统通过观察自然出现的任务示例来学习执行各种语言任务，而不需要专门的任务训练数据。

### 01. Introduction

Machine learning systems now excel (in expectation) at tasks they are trained for by using a combination of large datasets, high-capacity models, and supervised learning (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) (Sutskever et al., 2014) (Amodei et al., 2016). Yet these systems are brittle and sensitive to slight changes in the data distribution (Recht et al., 2018) and task specification (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). Current systems are better characterized as narrow experts rather than competent generalists. We would like to move towards more general systems which can perform many tasks – eventually without the need to manually create and label a training dataset for each one.

The dominant approach to creating ML systems is to collect a dataset of training examples demonstrating correct behavior for a desired task, train a system to imitate these behaviors, and then test its performance on independent and identically distributed (IID) held-out examples. This has served well to make progress on narrow experts. But the often erratic behavior of captioning models (Lake et al., 2017), reading comprehension systems (Jia & Liang, 2017), and image classifiers (Alcorn et al., 2018) on the diversity and variety of possible inputs highlights some of the shortcomings of this approach.

Our suspicion is that the prevalence of single task training on single domain datasets is a major contributor to the lack of generalization observed in current systems. Progress towards robust systems with current architectures is likely to require training and measuring performance on a wide range of domains and tasks. Recently, several benchmarks have been proposed such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and decaNLP (McCann et al., 2018) to begin studying this.

1 引言

机器学习系统现在通过结合大型数据集、高性能模型（high-capacity models）和监督学习，在其训练任务上取得了出色的平均表现（Krizhevsky et al., 2012）(Sutskever et al., 2014）(Amodei et al., 2016)。然而，这些系统往往缺乏鲁棒性，对数据分布（Recht et al., 2018）和任务规范（Kirkpatrick et al., 2017）的细微变化都很敏感。目前的系统更像是专精于特定领域的专家，而非能力全面的通才。我们的目标是开发更加通用的系统，使其能够执行多种任务，并最终无需为每项新任务手动创建和标注训练数据集。






目前，创建机器学习（Machine Learning, ML）系统的主流方法是这样的：首先收集一组训练样本，这些样本展示了特定任务的正确行为。然后，训练系统模仿这些行为，最后在独立的、具有相同分布特征的测试样本上评估系统性能。这种方法在培养针对特定任务的 AI 专家方面确实取得了不错的进展。然而，当我们仔细观察一些 AI 系统在面对各种复杂输入时的表现，就会发现这种方法存在明显的不足。例如，图像描述 AI（Lake et al., 2017)、机器阅读理解系统（Jia & Liang, 2017）和图像分类器（Alcorn et al., 2018）在处理多样化的输入时，常常会出现不稳定甚至错误的行为。

我们怀疑，造成当前 AI 系统缺乏通用适应能力的主要原因，是过于依赖在单一领域数据集上进行单一任务的训练。要想使用现有的 AI 架构开发出更加稳健可靠的系统，很可能需要在更广泛的领域和任务上进行训练和性能评估。为了开始研究这个问题，研究人员最近提出了几个综合性的评估基准，如 GLUE（Wang et al., 2018）和 decaNLP（McCann et al., 2018)。

Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997) is a promising framework for improving general performance. However, multitask training in NLP is still nascent. Recent work reports modest performance improvements (Yogatama et al., 2019) and the two most ambitious efforts to date have trained on a total of 10 and 17 (dataset, objective) pairs respectively (McCann et al., 2018) (Bowman et al., 2018). From a meta-learning perspective, each (dataset, objective) pair is a single training example sampled from the distribution of datasets and objectives. Current ML systems need hundreds to thousands of examples to induce functions which generalize well. This suggests that multitask training many need just as many effective training pairs to realize its promise with current approaches. It will be very difficult to continue to scale the creation of datasets and the design of objectives to the degree that may be required to brute force our way there with current techniques. This motivates exploring additional setups for performing multitask learning.


多任务学习（Multitask learning）(Caruana, 1997）是一个 promising 的框架，用于提高模型的整体性能。然而，在自然语言处理（NLP）领域，多任务训练仍处于起步阶段。最近的研究报告显示，这种方法只带来了有限的性能提升（Yogatama et al., 2019)。迄今为止，最具雄心的两项研究分别在 10 个和 17 个（数据集，目标）对上进行了训练（McCann et al., 2018）(Bowman et al., 2018)。

从元学习（meta-learning）的角度来看，每个（数据集，目标）对都可以被视为从数据集和目标分布中抽样的单个训练示例。当前的机器学习（ML）系统通常需要数百到数千个示例才能推导出具有良好泛化能力的函数。这意味着，使用当前的方法，多任务训练可能需要同样数量的有效训练对才能发挥其潜力。

然而，要继续扩大数据集的创建规模和设计更多的目标函数到可能需要的程度，将会非常困难。我们无法仅依靠现有技术通过蛮力来实现这一目标。这促使我们需要探索更多的多任务学习设置和方法。

The current best performing systems on language tasks utilize a combination of pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. This approach has a long history with a trend towards more flexible forms of transfer. First, word vectors were learned and used as inputs to task-specific architectures (Mikolov et al., 2013) (Collobert et al., 2011), then the contextual representations of recurrent networks were transferred (Dai & Le, 2015) (Peters et al., 2018), and recent work suggests that task-specific architectures are no longer necessary and transferring many self-attention blocks is sufficient (Radford et al., 2018) (Devlin et al., 2018).

**Figure 1.** Zero-shot task performance of WebText LMs as a function of model size on many NLP tasks. Reading Comprehension results are on CoQA (Reddy et al., 2018), translation on WMT-14 Fr-En (Artetxe et al., 2017), summarization on CNN and Daily Mail (See et al., 2017), and Question Answering on Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). Section 3 contains detailed descriptions of each result.


在语言相关任务中，目前表现最好的系统都采用了一种结合预训练和有监督微调的方法。这种方法有着悠久的历史，并且一直在朝着更灵活的知识迁移方向发展。这个发展过程大致如下：首先，研究人员学习词向量并将其用作特定任务模型的输入（Mikolov et al., 2013）(Collobert et al., 2011)。接着，研究者们开始迁移循环神经网络的上下文表示（Dai & Le, 2015）(Peters et al., 2018)。最近的研究表明，我们甚至不再需要为特定任务设计专门的模型结构，只需要迁移多个自注意力模块就足够了（Radford et al., 2018）(Devlin et al., 2018)。这种方法大大简化了模型设计过程，同时提高了模型的通用性。

** 图 1:** WebText 语言模型在多项自然语言处理（NLP）任务上的零样本学习性能，展示了模型大小与性能之间的关系。这里的 "零样本学习" 是指模型在没有经过特定任务训练的情况下，直接应用于新任务的能力。图中展示的任务包括：基于 CoQA 数据集的阅读理解（Reddy et al., 2018)、基于 WMT-14 法语 - 英语数据集的机器翻译（Artetxe et al., 2017)、使用 CNN 和 Daily Mail 数据的文本摘要生成（See et al., 2017)，以及基于 Natural Questions 数据集的问答任务（Kwiatkowski et al., 2019)。每项任务的详细结果分析请参见第 3 节。

These methods still require supervised training in order to perform a task. When only minimal or no supervised data is available, another line of work has demonstrated the promise of language models to perform specific tasks, such as commonsense reasoning (Schwartz et al., 2017) and sentiment analysis (Radford et al., 2017).

In this paper, we connect these two lines of work and continue the trend of more general methods of transfer. We demonstrate language models can perform down-stream tasks in a zero-shot setting – without any parameter or architecture modification. We demonstrate this approach shows potential by highlighting the ability of language models to perform a wide range of tasks in a zero-shot setting. We achieve promising, competitive, and state of the art results depending on the task.

传统的机器学习方法通常需要通过监督训练（supervised training）来完成特定任务。然而，当可用的标注数据非常有限甚至完全没有时，研究人员发现语言模型在执行某些特定任务时展现出了巨大的潜力。例如，在常识推理（Schwartz et al., 2017）和情感分析（Radford et al., 2017）等任务中，语言模型表现出色。

本文将这两条研究路线进行了结合，并进一步推动了更通用迁移学习方法的发展。我们证明了语言模型可以在零样本（zero-shot）设置下完成下游任务，而无需对模型参数或架构进行任何修改。通过展示语言模型在零样本情况下执行各种任务的能力，我们展示了这种方法的巨大潜力。根据不同任务的特点，我们的方法取得了令人鼓舞的、具有竞争力的，甚至是最先进的结果。



### 2. Approach

At the core of our approach is language modeling. Language modeling is usually framed as unsupervised distribution estimation from a set of examples $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ each composed of variable length sequences of symbols $(s_1, s_2, ..., s_n)$. Since language has a natural sequential ordering, it is common to factorize the joint probabilities over symbols as the product of conditional probabilities (Jelinek & Mercer, 1980) (Bengio et al., 2003):

$$
p(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(s_i|s_1, ..., s_{n-1})
$$

This approach allows for tractable sampling from and estimation of $p(x)$ as well as any conditionals of the form $p(s_{n-k+1}, ..., s_n|s_1, ..., s_{n-k})$. In recent years, there have been significant improvements in the expressiveness of models that can compute these conditional probabilities, such as self-attention architectures like the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).

Learning to perform a single task can be expressed in a probabilistic framework as estimating the conditional distribution $p(output|input)$. Since a general system should be able to perform many different tasks, even for the same input, it should condition not only on the input but also on the task to be performed. That is, it should model $p(output|input, task)$. This has been variously formalized in multitask and meta-learning settings. Task conditioning is often implemented at an architectural level, such as the task specific encoders and decoders in (Kaiser et al., 2017) or at an algorithmic level such as the inner and outer loop optimization framework of MAML (Finn et al., 2017). But as exemplified in McCann et al. (2018), language provides a flexible way to specify tasks, inputs, and outputs all as a sequence of symbols. For example, a translation training example can be written as the sequence $(translate\ to\ french,\ english\ text, \ french\ text)$. Likewise, a reading comprehension training example can be written as $(answer\ the\ question,\ document,\ question,\ answer)$. McCann et al. (2018) demonstrated it was possible to train a single model, the MQAN,


Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners

to infer and perform many different tasks on examples with this type of format.

Language modeling is also able to, in principle, learn the tasks of McCann et al. (2018) without the need for explicit supervision which supplies the order the inputs to be predicted. Since the supervised objective is the same as the unsupervised objective but only evaluated on a subset of the sequence, the global minimum of the unsupervised objective is also the global minimum of the supervised objective. In this slightly toy setting, the concerns with density estimation as a principled training objective discussed in (Sutskever et al., 2015) are side stepped. The problem instead becomes whether we are able to, in practice, optimize the unsupervised objective to convergence. Preliminary experiments confirmed that sufficiently large language models are able to perform multitask learning in this toy-ish setup but learning is much slower than in explicitly supervised approaches.

While it is a large step from the well-posed setup described above to the messiness of "language in the wild", Weston (2016) argues, in the context of dialog, for the need to develop systems capable of learning from natural language directly and demonstrated a proof of concept – learning a QA task without a reward signal by using forward prediction of a teacher’s outputs. While dialog is an attractive approach, we worry of its brittleness: their entire content was author specified and the nation is not passively available observed the need for interactive communication. Our speculation is that a language model with sufficient capacity will begin to learn to infer and perform the tasks demonstrated in natural language sequences in order to better predict them, regardless of their method of procurement. If a language model is able to do this it will be, in effect, performing unsupervised multitask learning. We test whether this is the case by analyzing the performance of language models in a zero-shot setting on a wide variety of tasks.

2.1. Training Dataset

Most prior work trained language models on a single domain of text, such as news articles (Jozefowicz et al., 2016), Wikipedia (Merity et al., 2016), or fiction books (Kiros et al., 2015). Our approach motivates building as large and diverse a dataset as possible in order to collect natural language demonstrations of tasks in as varied of domains and contexts as possible.

A promising source of diverse and nearly unlimited text is web scrapes such as Common Crawl. While these archives are many orders of magnitude larger than current language modeling datasets, they have significant data quality issues. Trinh & Le (2018) used Common Crawl in their work on commonsense reasoning but noted a large amount of documents "whose content are mostly unintelligible". We ob- served similar data issues in our initial experiments with 

"I'm not the cleverest man in the world, but like they say in French: Je ne suis pas un imbecile [I'm not a fool]."

In a now-deleted post from Aug. 16, Soheil Eid, Tory candidate in the riding of Joliette, wrote in French: "Mentez mentez, il en restera toujours quelque chose," which translates as, "Lie lie and something will always remain."

"I hate the word 'perfume,'" Burr says. "It's somewhat better in French: 'parfum'."

If listened carefully at 29:55, a conversation can be heard between two guys in French: "Comment on fait pour aller de I'autre cote? -Quel autre cote?", which means - "How do you get to the other side? - What side?".

If this sounds like a bit of a stretch, consider this question in French: As-tu aller au cinema?, or Did you go to the movies?, which literally translates as Have-you go to movies/theater?

"Brevet Sans Garantie Du Gouvernement", translated to English: "Patented without government warranty".

Common Crawl. Trinh & Le (2018)'s best results were achieved by using a subset of Common Crawl in which they filtered out unintelligible content – about 90% of the dataset. While we found this heuristic effective for filtering out dirty documents, it resulted in a much narrower distribution of documents. All re- sults presented in this paper use a preliminary version of WebText which does not include links created after Dec 2017 and which after de-duplication and some heuristic based cleaning contains slightly over 8 million documents for a total of 40 GB of text. We removed all Wikipedia documents from WebText since it is a common data source for other datasets and could complicate analysis due to over

lapping training data with test evaluation tasks.

#### 2.2. Input Representation

A general language model (LM) should be able to compute the probability of (and also generate) any string. Current large scale LMs include pre-processing steps such as lower-casing, tokenization, and out-of-vocabulary tokens which restrict the space of model-able strings. While processing Unicode strings as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes elegantly fulfills this requirement as exemplified in work such as Gillick et al. (2015), current byte-level LMs are not competitive with word-level LMs on large scale datasets such as the One Billion Word Benchmark (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). We observed a similar performance gap in our own attempts to train standard byte-level LMs on WebText.

Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2015) is a practical middle ground between character and word level language modeling which effectively interpolates between word level inputs for frequent symbol sequences and character level inputs for infrequent symbol sequences. Despite its name, reference BPE implementations often operate on Unicode code points and not byte sequences. These implementations would require including the full space of Unicode symbols in order to model all Unicode strings. This would result in an base vocabulary of over 130,000 before any multi-symbol tokens are added. This is prohibitively large compared to the 32,000 to 64,000 token vocabularies often used when applying BPE. In contrast, a byte-level version of BPE only requires a base vocabulary size of 256. However, directly applying BPE to the byte sequence results in suboptimal merges due to BPE using a greedy frequency based heuristic for building the token vocabulary. We observed BPE including many versions of common words like dog since they occur in many variations such as `dog`, `dog.` `dog?`. This results in a sub-optimal allocation of limited vocabulary slots and model capacity. To avoid this, we prevent BPE from merging across character categories for any byte sequence. We add an exception for spaces which significantly improves the compression efficiency while adding only minimal fragmentation of words across multiple vocab tokens.

This input representation allows us to combine the empirical benefits of word-level LMs with the generality of byte-level approaches. Since our approach can assign a probability to any Unicode string, this allows us to evaluate our LMs on any dataset regardless of pre-processing, tokenization, or vocab size.

#### 2.3. Model

We use a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based architecture for our LMs. The model largely follows the details of the OpenAI GPT model (Radford et al., 2018) with a few modifications. Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) was moved to the input of each sub-block, similar to a pre-activation residual network (He et al., 2016) and an additional layer normalization was added after the final self-attention block. A modified initialization which accounts for the accumulation on the residual path within each model is used. We scale the weights of residual layers at initialization by a factor of $1/\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of residual layers. The vocabulary is expanded to 50,257. We also increase the context size from 512 to 1024 tokens and a larger batchsize of 512 is used.

Table 2: Architecture hyperparameters for the 4 model sizes.






### 3. Experiments

We trained and benchmarked four LMs with approximately log-uniformly spaced sizes. The architectures are summarized in Table 2. The smallest model is equivalent to the original GPT, and the second smallest equivalent to the largest model from BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). Our largest model, which we call GPT-2, has an order of magnitude more parameters than GPT. The learning rate of each model was manually tuned for the best perplexity on a 5% held-out sample of WebText. All models still underfit Web-Text and held-out perplexity has as of yet improved given more training time.

#### 3.1. Language Modeling

As an initial step towards zero-shot task transfer, we are interested in understanding how WebText LM's perform at zero-shot domain transfer on the primary task they are trained for – language modeling. Since our model operates on a byte level and does not require lossy pre-processing or tokenization, we can evaluate it on any language model benchmark. Results on language modeling datasets are commonly reported in a quantity which is a scaled or exponentiated version of the average negative log probability per canonical prediction unit - usually a character, a byte, or a word. We evaluate the same quantity by computing the log-probability of a dataset according to a WebText LM and dividing by the number of canonical units. For many of these datasets, WebText LMs would be tested significantly out-of-distribution, having to predict aggressively standardized text, tokenization artifacts such as disconnected punctuation and contractions, shuffled sentences, and even the string

Table 3: Zero-shot results on many datasets. No training or fine-tuning was performed for any of these results. PTB and WikiText-2 results are from (Gong et al., 2018). CBT results are from (Bajgar et al., 2016). LAMBADA accuracy result is from (Hoang et al., 2018) and LAMBADA perplexity result is from (Grave et al., 2016). Other results are from (Dai et al., 2019).

<UNK> which is extremely rare in WebText - occurring only 26 times in 40 billion bytes. We report our main re- sults in Table 3 using invertible de-tokenizers which remove as many of these tokenization / pre-processing artifacts as possible. Since these de-tokenizers are invertible, we can still calculate the log probability of a dataset and they can be thought of as a simple form of domain adaptation. We observe gains of 2.5 to 5 perplexity for GPT-2 with these de-tokenizers.

WebText LMs transfer well across domains and datasets, improving the state of the art on 8 of the 8 datasets in a zero-shot setting. Large improvements are noticed on small datasets such as Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 which have only 1 to 2 million training tokens. Large improvements are also noticed on datasets created to measure long-term dependencies like LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016) and the Children’s Book Test (Hill et al., 2015). Our model is still significantly worse than prior work on the One Billion Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013). This is likely due to a combination of it being both the largest dataset and having some of the most destructive pre-processing - 1BW's sentence level shuffling removes all long-range structure.

#### 3.2. Children’s Book Test

Figure 2: Performance on the Children’s Book Test as a function of model capacity. Human performance are from Bajgar et al. (2016), instead of the much lower estimates from the original paper.

The Children’s Book Test (CBT) (Hill et al., 2015) was created to examine the performance of LMs on different cat- egories of words: named entities, nouns, verbs, and preposi- tions. Rather than reporting perplexity as an evaluation met- ric, CBT reports accuracy on an automatically constructed cloze test where the task is to predict which of 10 possible choices for an omitted word is correct. Following the LM approach introduced in the original paper, we compute the probability of each choice and the of the sentence con- ditioned on this choice according to the LM, and predict the one with the highest probability. As seen in Figure 2 performance steadily improves as model size is increased and closes the majority of the gap to human performance on this test. Data overlap analysis showed none of the CBT test books, The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling, is in WebText, so we report results on the validation set which has no significant overlap. GPT-2 achieves new state of the art results of 93.3% on common nouns and 89.1% on named entities. A de-tokenizer was applied to remove PTB style tokenization artifacts from CBT.

#### 3.3 LAMBADA

The LAMBADA dataset (Paperno et al., 2016) tests the ability of systems to model long-range dependencies in text. The task is to predict the final word of sentences which require at least 50 tokens of context for a human to successfully predict. GPT-2 improves the state of the art from 99.8 (Grave et al., 2016) to 8.6 perplexity and increases the accuracy of LMs on this test from 19% (Dehghani et al., 2018) to 52.66%. Investigating GPT-2’s errors showed most predictions are valid continuations of the sentence, but are not valid final words. This suggests that the LM is not using the additional useful constraint that the word must be the final of the sentence. Adding a stop-word filter as an approximation to this further increases accuracy to 63.24%, improving the overall state of the art on this task by 44%. The previous state of the art (Hoang et al., 2018) used a different restricted prediction setting where the outputs of the model were constrained to only words that appeared in the context. For GPT-2, this restriction is harmful rather than helpful


#### 3.4. Winograd Schema Challenge

![5_1.png](5_1.png)

Figure 3. Performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge as a function of model capacity.

The Winograd Schema challenge (Levesque et al., 2012) was constructed to measure the capability of a system to perform commonsense reasoning by measuring its ability to resolve ambiguities in text. Recently Trinh & Le (2018) demonstrated significant progress on this challenge using LMs, by predicting the resolution of the ambiguity with higher probability. We follow their problem formulation and visualize the performance of our models with both full and partial scoring techniques in Figure 3. GPT-2 improves state of the art accuracy by 7%, achieving 70.70%. The dataset is quite small with only 273 examples so we recommend reading Trichelair et al. (2018) to help contextualize this result.

#### 3.5. Reading Comprehension

The Conversation Question Answering dataset (CoQA) Reddy et al. (2018) consists of documents from 7 different domains paired with natural language dialogues between a question asker and a question answerer about the document. CoQA tests reading comprehension capabilities and also the ability of models to answer questions that depend on conversation history (such as “Why?”).

Greedy decoding from GPT-2 when conditioned on a document, the history of the associated conversation, and a final token A: achieves 85 F1 on the development set. This matches or exceeds the performance of 3 out of 4 baselines systems without using the 127,000+ manually collected question answer pairs those baselines were trained on. The supervised SOTA, a BERT based system (Devlin et al., 2018), is nearing the 89 F1 performance of humans. While GPT-2's performance is exciting for a system without any supervised training, some inspection of its answers and errors suggests GPT-2 often uses simple retrieval based heuristics such as answer with a name from the document in response to a who question.

#### 3.6. Summarization

We test GPT-2's ability to perform summarization on the CNN and Daily Mail dataset (Nallapati et al., 2016). To induce summarization behavior we add the text TL;DR: after the article and generate 100 tokens with Top-k random sampling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 2 which reduces diversity and encourages more abstractive summaries than greedy decoding. We use the first 3 generated sentences of these 100 tokens as the summary. While qualitatively the generations resemble summaries, as shown in Table 4, they often focus on recent content from the article or confuse specific details such as how many cars were involved in a crash or whether a logo was on a hat or shirt. On the commonly reported ROUGE 1,2,L metrics the generated summaries only begin to approach the performance of classic neural baselines and just barely outperforms selecting 3 random sentences from the article. GPT-2's performance drops by 6.4 points on the aggregate metric when the task hint is removed which demonstrates the ability to invoke task specific behavior in a language model with natural language.

#### 3.7. Translation

We test whether GPT-2 has begun to learn how to translate from one language to another. In order to help it infer that this is the desired task, we condition the language model on a context of example pairs of the format $english\: sentence \rightarrow french\: sentence$ and then after a final prompt of $english\: sentence \rightarrow$ we sample from the model with greedy decoding and use the first generated sentence as the translation. On the WMT-14 English-French test set, GPT-2 gets 5 BLEU, which is slightly worse than a word-by-word substitution with a bilingual lexicon inferred in previous work on unsupervised word translation.

#### 4. Generalization vs Memorization

Recent work in computer vision has shown that common image datasets contain a non-trivial amount of near-duplicate images. For instance CIFAR-10 has 3.3% overlap between train and test images (Barz & Denzler, 2019). This results in an over-reporting of the generalization performance of machine learning systems. As the size of datasets increases this issue becomes increasingly likely which suggests a similar phenomena could be happening with WebText. Therefore it is important to analyze how much test data also shows up in the training data.

To study this we created Bloom filters containing 8-grams of WebText training sets. To improve recall, strings were normalized to contain only lower-cased alphanumeric words with a single space as a delimiter. The bloom filters were constructed such that the false positive rate is upper bounded by $ \frac{1}{10}^6 $. We then verified the low false positive rate by generating 1M strings, of which zero were found by the filter.

These Bloom filters let us calculate, given a dataset, the percentage of 8-grams from that dataset that are also found in the WebText training set. Table 6 shows this overlap analysis for the test sets of common LM benchmarks. Common LM datasets' test sets have between 1-6% overlap with WebText train, with an average of overlap of 3.2%. Somewhat surprisingly, many datasets have larger overlaps with their own training splits, with an average of 5.9% overlap.

Our approach optimizes for recall, and while manual inspection of the overlaps shows many common phrases, there are many longer matches that are due to duplicated data. This is not unique to WebText. For instance, we discovered that the test set of WikiText-103 has an article which is also in the training dataset. Since there are only 60 articles in the test set there is at least an overlap of 1.6%. Potentially more worryingly, 1BW has an overlap of nearly 13.2% with its own training set according to our procedure.

For the Winograd Schema Challenge, we found only 10 schema which had any 8-gram overlaps with the WebText training set. Of these, 2 were spurious matches. Of the remaining 8, only 1 schema appeared in any contexts that gave away the answer.

For CoQA, about 15% of documents in the news domain are already in WebText and the model performs about 3 F1 better on these. CoQA's development set metric reports the average performance over 5 different domains and we measure a gain of about 0.5-1.0 F1 due to overlap across the various domains. However, no actual training questions or answers are in WebText since coQA was released after the cutoff date for links in WebText.

On LAMBADA, the average overlap is 1.2%. GPT-2 performs about 2 perplexity better on examples with greater than 15% overlap. Recalculating metrics when excluding all examples with any overlap shifts results from 8.6 to 8.7 perplexity and reduces accuracy from 63.2% to 62.9%. This very small change in overall results is likely due to only 1 in 200 examples having significant overlap.

Overall, our analysis suggests that data overlap between WebText training data and specific evaluation datasets provides a small but consistent benefit to reported results. However, for most datasets we do not notice significantly larger overlaps than those already existing between standard training and test sets, as Table 6 highlights.

Understanding and quantifying how highly similar text impacts performance is an important research question. Better de-duplication techniques such as scalable fuzzy matching could also help better answer these questions. For now, we recommend the use of n-gram overlap based de-duplication as an important verification step and sanity check during the creation of training and test splits for new NLP datasets.

Another potential way of determining whether the performance of WebText LMs is attributable to memorization is inspecting their performance on their own held-out set. As shown in Figure 4, performance on both the training and test sets of WebText are similar and improve together as model size is increased. This suggests even GPT-2 is still underfitting on WebText in many ways.

GPT-2 is also able to write news articles about the discovery of talking unicorns. An example is provided in Table 13.

improved the RNN based fine-tuning approaches of (Dai & Le, 2015). (Conneau et al., 2017a) studied the transfer performance of representations learned by natural language inference models and (Subramanian et al., 2018) explored large-scale multitask training.

(Ramachandran et al., 2016) demonstrated that seq2seq models benefit from being initialized with pre-trained language models as encoders and decoders. More recent work has shown that LM pre-training is helpful when fine-tuned for difficult generation tasks like chit-chat dialog and dialog based question answering systems as well (Wolf et al., 2019) (Dinan et al., 2018).

#### 6. Discussion

Much research has been dedicated to learning (Hill et al., 2016), understanding (Levy & Goldberg, 2014), and critically evaluating (Wieting & Kiela, 2019) the representations of both supervised and unsupervised pre-training methods. Our results suggest that unsupervised task learning is an additional promising area of research to explore. These findings potentially help explain the widespread success of pre-training techniques for down-stream NLP tasks as we show that, in the limit, one of these pre-training techniques begins to learn to perform tasks directly without the need for supervised adoption or modification.

Ongoing reading comprehension research suggests that GPT-2 is competitive with supervised baselines in a zero-shot setting. However, on other tasks such as summarization, while it is qualitatively performing the task, its performance is still only rudimentary according to quantitative metrics. While suggestive as a research result, in terms of practical applications, the zero-shot performance of GPT-2 is still far from useful.

We have studied the zero-shot performance of WebText LMs on many canonical NLP tasks, but there are many additional tasks that could be evaluated. There are undoubtedly many practical tasks where the performance of GPT-2 is still no better than random. Even on common tasks that we evaluated on, such as question answering and translation, language models only begin to outperform trivial baselines when they have sufficient capacity.

While zero-shot performance establishes a baseline of the potential performance of GPT-2 on many tasks, it is not clear where the ceiling is with finetuning. On some tasks, GPT-2's fully abstractive output is a significant departure from the extractive pointer network approach (Vinyals et al., 2015) based outputs which are currently state of the art on many question answering and reading comprehension datasets. Given the prior success of fine-tuning GPT, we plan to investigate fine-tuning on benchmarks such as decaNLP and GLUE, especially since it is unclear whether the additional


## 7. Conclusion

When a large language model is trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset it is able to perform well across many domains and datasets. GPT-2 zero-shots to state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 tested language model- ing datasets. The diversity of tasks the model is able to perform in a zero-shot setting suggests that high-capacity models trained to maximize the likelihood of a sufficiently varied text corpus begin to learn how to perform a surprising amount of tasks without the need for explicit supervision.$^5$

# 8. Appendix A: Samples

## 8.1. Model capacity

To complement the reported perplexity gains of bigger LMs on WebText shown in Figure 4, Tables 7 through 11 show side-by-side completions of the smallest WebText LM and GPT-2 on random unseen WebText test set articles.

## 8.2. Text Memorization

We observe some memorizing behavior in GPT-2 on longer strings that are repeated many times in the dataset such as famous quotes or speeches. For example, when conditioned on the first sentence and a half of the Gettysburg Address (which occurs approximately 40 times throughout WebText), an argmax decode from GPT-2 recovers the speech. Even when sampling without truncation, we find that the model copies the speech for awhile before drifting, albeit in a similar style. It typically drifts within 100-200 tokens, and displays widening diversity once it drifts.

To quantify how often exact memorization shows up in samples, we generated samples from GPT-2 conditioned on WebText test set articles and compared the overlap rates of GPT-2's generations to the overlap rates of the ground-truth completions. The results of this analysis are shown below and suggest that GPT-2 repeats text from the training set less often then the baseline rate of held-out articles.

Figure 5. CDF of percentage 8-gram overlap with WebText training set, for both WebText test set and samples (conditioned on WebText test set, with top-k untruncated random sampling with $k = 40$). Most samples have less than 1% overlap, including over 30% of samples with no overlap, whereas the median for test set is 2.6% overlap.

## 8.3. Diversity

Table 12 shows multiple completions of the same random WebText test set context, showing the diversity of completions with standard sampling settings. 

## 8.4. Robustness

Table 13 shows the previously mentioned talking unicorns news article. We find the model to be capable of handling out of distribution contexts, but the quality of these samples is generally lower.

#### Outfit 1: Typical
This pairing was the first outfit I thought of when I bought the shoes. It’s like a summer version of this Jake Grantham outfit; in fact, my shoes are close to the colors of his Nike Racers! Instead of a heavy Harris Tweed jacket and denim shirt, I’m wearing a cotton DB jacket and a linen shirt. Both fabrics (in these colors) are an absolute must for summer, as they go with both dark and light pants! As you can see, they pair wonderfully with the dark jeans and shoes. It’s a pseudo menswear/prep outfit.

Overall, this is a very casual outfit which is why I paired my sneakers with it. I’m not about wearing a full wool suit with sneakers (as GQ shows a lot) but I’m definitely open to keeping things casual, like this cotton DB. Casual fabrics are key to pulling off your sneakers in a dressed down menswear outfit. I’d even suggest to wear these sneakers with a khaki chino suit or a white linen suit. Just be sure to ditch the tie or wear a tee or polo; wearing a tie with sneakers is a bit too much.

##### Outfit 2: Casual Jacket
I know that some people might be opposed to wearing sneakers in a turtleneck, but I wanted to be true to myself, so I went with a slim fitting turtleneck in a color more similar to my favorite color of the day. Overall, it’s a classic turtleneck, with nothing too flashy. I did swap my shoes for these ASICS Tiger Killshots and I wish I hadn’t did that. The shoe itself is very comfortable, however, I found that wearing them in these sneakers made my feet look a bit larger. I’d wear them with denim, chinos, whatever, but would never recommend wearing them alone. There are just too many variables involved.

#### Outfit 2: High End
This outfit was just in the eye of the storm. It’s a hybrid of what ASICS does with streetwear (like J. Crew) and what J. Crew does with casual pieces that are a bit more traditional. Again, as I mentioned before, it’s a low budget item and they can be very expensive. These will definitely be an issue if you’re trying to work as a casual sneakermaker, and that’s OK but don’t hesitate if you want to try the lower price versions of their outfits!

This version features a very low cut-cut neckline (which is not a bad thing), slightly longer legs, and a pair of long legs to keep things nice. My preferred color of color these items are blue-gray (which is my first colors, as they are a light white), or black (which is my favorite of my designs). As always, my pick of colors from this store have nothing to do with that other than the design. For a high end, I would recommend this to everyone!

#### Outfit 3: High Light
This was a ”high light” look while I had a chance to get some color. I think the color is based on

#### Outfit 3: Dress
This is the final outfit I wore the ASICS Tiger Killshots. This version of the ASICS is a much more modern and streamlined version. The shoe has the most modern and minimal design that I can think of! With a lot of black, these sneakers look very cool. They’ll definitely be very comfortable for summer.

To me, wearing them with a suit is the easiest way to have a good pair of sneaker shoes. That’s pretty much it! If

Some of the most glorious historical attractions in Spain date from the period of Muslim rule, including The Mezquita, built as the Great Mosque of Córdoba and the Medina Azahara, also in Córdoba and now in ruins but still visitable as such and built as the Madinat al-Zahra, the Palace of al-Andalus; and the Alhambra in Granada, a splendid, intact palace. There are also two synagogues still standing that were built during the era of Muslim Spain: Santa María la Blanca in Toledo and the Synagogue of Córdoba, in the Old City.

## Reconquista and Imperial era [ edit ]
#### Small model completion
The era of Muslim Spain is very different from that of other parts of the world, with a rather extensive medieval history. While the Spanish Empire existed during the second half of the 9th century BC it was quite slowly transformed to a small, secularized empire by 1150 A.D., in a much more prosperous and diverse state. In 1050 CE the emperor of Naples, at least partially in characterised by a series of wars and invasions from the north-western coast to the western coast of the region (e.g., on the Danube River which extended all the way from Gibraltar into the south of Spain, but was quickly destroyed on the same day by the Roman army), assumed the title of Emperor of Naples. He made a large contribution over the last few decades to restore and maintain the empire, the first of which to the west. His successors were Ferdinand, who took power from the Papal Throne in 1148, while the first imperial successor was King Alfred II of Sweden. The empire was again made one of the few independent states in the European Continent and although no more than 200 million people lived on its territory during this period the people had much to say to the Emperor. From 1720 on the Muslims made up half the population of Spain.

The Reconquista (literally, "The return to the country") of 1092 and 1095 saw the establishment in the Iberian peninsula of a united kingdom of Castile and Aragon in which a Muslim dynasty would exist. This was the last time in Europe where Muslim rule would be considered "native" and the last occasion where Christian-inflamed and organized conflicts would make themselves known in Europe.

The reign of Muslim Moors in Spain is often referred to, especially among non-Muslims, as the "Conquest of Granada" and Spain is sometimes referred to as Spain in "Granada". The last years of Muslim rule were followed by the Spanish Reconquista where the Muslims were driven or compelled out of the Iberian Peninsula with the victory of Ferdinand IX. in the Battle of Poitiers in March 1189 and the conquest of Jerusalem in 1187 by Saladin.

The Reconquista period in Spain came to an end when the Moors retreated north. However the Moorish rule would not be fully replaced by the Christian rule until the Reconquista era resumed when the Reconquista lasted from 1229 to 1492.

The last Muslim state in Spain, Granada, was conquered by the

**Pinky**

The pink ghost’s AI is designed to ”feel” opposite of the red ghost’s behavior. Pinky actually attempts to get out in front of Pac-Man. This is accomplished by setting the target 4 tiles ahead of Pac-Man’s current location in the direction that Pac-Man is travelling. One exception to this is when Pac-Man is traveling up. Due to an overflow bug in the code, the calculation includes a left offset equal to the expected up offset.

The use of Pac-Man’s expected position allows the player to exploit the navigation code for Pinky. This was most often seen in situations where Pac-Man and Pinky are in close proximity to each other. For example, if they were headed toward one another, once they are less than 4 tiles apart, the target tile is now behind Pinky. If he encounters an intersection while in this configuration, he will attempt to double-back (by turning in) in order to reach the target tile.

Player’s would often perform what was referred to as a ”head fake” by changing directions rapidly just as Pinky was approaching an intersection. By displacing the target tile just as Pinky

was coming to the left, they would get the ”correct” direction.

If the location is actually farther from what Pac-Man was at, the player’s will not respond to the ghost’s movement, and the ghost will instead return to the player’s current location. This is because Pac-Man does not move by turning.

The ghost will have to go to another location of the same time it return where he began, and this is achieved in many ways. It will often simply leave the location, for example if Pac-Man did jump off a cliff, he would return to the spot where he was before vanishing into space. There is a good number of possibilities these ghost paths may be possible, but the most obvious ones are if the player wants to avoid getting caught up in the game, with a goal as easy as keeping Pac-Man in the game for 1/3 as long as he was.

Chasing

In Pac-Man’s case, this would be similar to how Pac-Man can ”catch up” in a fight.

A ghost could chase through enemies. This is useful for many reasons, both for Pac-Man and his AI. Unlike most Ghost games, this ghost simply travels in the

was about to cross the intersection, Pac-Man would be able to dodge the ghosts’ projectiles and return to the safe location of the safe house.

Buster

The yellow ghost’s AI is specifically designed to try to avoid Pac-Man from leaving the safe house. The player must press the SPACE bar to reveal the safe house’s doors, then go into them to find the yellow ghost hiding in the next room.

The player must also note that the ghost will not attempt to exit the safe house if it sees Pac-Man already there. In fact, the ghost will not attempt an exit in the first place unless they’re already in the safe house.

These two behaviors are based on the fact that the player does not always attempt to reach the safe house before Pac-Man (or Blinky).

The player must also beware of this glitch if a ghost (or another player) is already in the safe house and attempting to get out as soon as Pac-Man or Blinky is gone. At this point, the ghost will attempt to exit the safe house in a similar manner as it is in ”Chase” mode.

There are some ghosts that follow Pac-Man. These ghosts are

Corporal Michael P. Goeldin was an unskilled laborer from Ireland when he enlisted in Company A in November 1860. Goeldin survived the war. Corporal Patrick O’Neal, also from Ireland, first enlisted in 1854 and served with Company L, 3d U.S. Artillery, in Oregon. He returned to the East Coast and enlisted in the company in 1860. O’Neal served until 1874, when he was named superintendent of the National Cemetery at Willets Point, New York. Corporal Benjamin Browne was a shoemaker from Orange County, New York. In August 1862, he enlisted in the newly formed 124th New York Volunteers, and was one of sixty-one men who transferred into Company A that October. Browne reenlisted in the company in February 1864 while it was camped at Brandy Station. He returned to civilian life after completing his enlistment in 1867.

On 10 June, Artificer William Collins was promoted to corporal, probably to fill a combat leadership void for the crossing of the James River. Collins’s service record does not reflect the qualities he demonstrated to earn this promotion, but he had obviously overcome some serious problems. Born in Sacketts Harbor, New York, Collins enlisted in the company in December 1853 at the age of twenty-two, and reenlisted in December 1858. Just a month before the war began in April 1861, Collins went “over the hill” and was not caught until three years later. Tried for the desertion on 22 March 1864, he was tried

As an engineer, Collins also had training in engineering. After graduating in 1916 in the Union College of Engineering, he was employed in the United States Army for two years at the same time. There he worked under Captain Daniel Pfeiffer and was promoted to colonel in May 1870, three years after Captain Pfeiffer’s enlistment. Collins returned home to England after completing his first year in the First Division to serve the next two years in the Army Corps of Engineers, and by his second year, he began to experience his service duty.；---

Captain James J. Dall was born in Virginia in 1829 during the Revolution and joined his father in the Army in 1836. He served with the 2d Virginia Infantry until 1845, when he went to the Western Reserve Regiment; and, on his discharge, he reenlisted with Company I, 25th New York Volunteers (which in 1845 numbered about 4,500 men). One of his brothers, James, served with his company in the same capacity in the same brigade. While the regiment remained in Connecticut through 1846, Captain Dall served with Company I at various times before his discharge. A veteran of the Mexican War, he had served two years on the staff of Brigadier General John J. Sullivan at San Antonio. During the Peninsula Campaign of 1863, he commanded a company of twenty-three and was in charge of the battery of fifty-four heavy mortars and the gunboat Pinta of the Battery, a gunboat and several other boats. Captain Dall was on active duty with Company I in the fall of 1865. Two years later, he was promoted to second lieutenant.

#### Xmonad, Xresources, and Fonts

Xresources can be an absolute pain (they were for me). So, this a bit of help:

First of all, the way that fonts are generally handled in Xmonad is through XFT. Xft is the X FreeType Interface library and is that handles the actual rendering of fonts in Xmonad/urxvt (Xresources specifies a bunch of resources to things that launch under the X window manager. Settings for individual programs are specified in Xresources like so: Urxvt.background:background settins here).

Anyway, fonts are set using this syntax in Xresources:

```
urxvt*font:xft:your font name goes here:size=the size of the font goes here,xft:fall-back font 1 goes here
```

So, thats the most basic part of fonts in urxvt specified via Xresources.

##### Fixing /.ssh/ Permissions in Cygwin

I found I could make that much more workable with just typing the username with your mouse then trying to set permissions to be "0600" for the group, which is what my system is now configured to do. | , making these files read-only. I tried just starting ssh and using a program like passwd which modifies the owner/group to 0644 permissions, but it didn't work. It was annoying but not nearly as bad as it could be, just annoying to have to fiddle with permissions. |

However, as of Cygwin 7 on Linux I have found that doing so is now "unnecessary" for my system! I also installed a package called chroot. It does that by allowing you to install/upgrade to your system directory.

So, as of Windows 8 and up, installing that can require chroot, so I tried and tried and found that it wasn't so bad when installing the package on Linux and then uninstalling it. As of my last write-up on Cygwin, the script just does its job (the sudo commands do the rest), if you try it you will have to log the change.

If that wasn't confusing enough, this is what I tried and just went back to my /.ssh/ directory and the chroot script. I found I was finally running out of permissions (because i forgot to create a symlink to ssh from the file system and

So I decided to do this as the reverse:

For each .ssh folder in your Cygwin directory, set the permission of each file and directory to 2644. Then start ssh with: ssh-add /.ssh/

The first time you connect, your permissions of the /.ssh folder that you just had in Cygwin will be set to 0600. Then every time you connect again, your permissions will change to 0644.

**Context (human-written):** In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.

**GPT-2:** The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.

Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.

Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.

Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.

Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns.

While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.”

Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.

While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Pérez, “In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.”

However, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. “But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization,” said the scientist.

Tom goes everywhere with Catherine Green, a 54-year-old secretary. He moves around her office at work and goes shopping with her. "Most people don’t seem to mind Tom," says Catherine, who thinks he is wonderful. "He’s my fourth child," she says. She may think of him and treat him that way as her son. He moves around buying his food, paying his health bills and his taxes, but in fact Tom is a dog.

Catherine and Tom live in Sweden, a country where everyone is expected to lead an orderly life according to rules laid down by the government, which also provides a high level of care for its people. This level of care costs money.

People in Sweden pay taxes on everything, so aren’t surprised to find that owning a dog means more taxes. Some people are paying as much as 500 Swedish kronor in taxes a year for the right to keep their dog, which is spent by the government on dog hospitals and sometimes medical treatment for a dog that falls ill. However, most such treatment is expensive, so owners often decide to offer health and even life - for their dog.

In Sweden dog owners must pay for any damage their dog does. A Swedish Kennel Club official explains what this means: if your dog runs out on the road and gets hit by a passing car, you, as the owner, have to pay for any damage done to the car, even if your dog has been killed in the accident.

Q: How old is Catherine?  
A: 54

Q: where does she live?  
A:

**Model answer:** Stockholm  
**Turker answers:** Sweden, Sweden, in Sweden, Sweden
