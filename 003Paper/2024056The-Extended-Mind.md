The Extended Mind

by Andy Clark David Chalmers'(1998)

### 1. Introduction

Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin? The question invites two standard replies. Some accept the boundaries of skin and skull, and say that what is outside the body is outside the mind. Others are impressed by arguments suggesting that the meaning of our words 'just ain't in the head', and hold that this externalism about meaning carries over into an externalism about mind. We propose to pursue a third position. We advocate a very different sort of externalism: an active externalism. based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.

思维的边界究竟在哪里？世界又从何处开始？这个哲学性的问题通常会引发两种传统观点。一些学者坚持以人体的生理边界（皮肤和颅骨）为界，认为身体外的一切都超出了思维的范畴。另一些研究者则受到语言意义「不仅仅存在于大脑内部」的理论启发，主张意义的外在性可以延伸到心灵本身的外在性。

我们提出了第三种更为开放的观点：一种基于环境在认知过程中积极作用的主动外在主义（Active Externalism）。这一理论认为，环境并非思维的被动背景，而是认知过程中的主动参与者和共同构建者。

### 2. Extended cognition

Consider three cases of human problem-solving:

(1) A person sits in front of a computer screen which displays images of various two-dimensional geometric shapes and is asked to answer questions concerning the potential fit of such shapes into depicted 'sockets'. To assess fit, the person must mentally rotate the shapes to align them with the sockets.

(1）在一项实验中，受试者被安排在计算机屏幕前，屏幕上展示了各种不同的二维几何形状。他们的任务是判断这些形状是否能够完美契合所给出的几何凹槽。为此，受试者需要在心理上将形状进行旋转，以确定是否能准确匹配。

(2) A person sits in front of a similar computer screen, but this time can choose either to physically rotate the image on the screen, by pressing a rotate button, or to mentally rotate the image as before. We can also suppose, not unrealistically, that some speed advantage accrues to the physical rotation operation.

(2）这次，受试者面对同样的电脑屏幕，但他们可以自主选择：要么通过点击旋转按钮实际物理旋转图像，要么像之前一样在脑海中进行想象旋转。我们可以合理推测，物理操作旋转很可能会比纯意念旋转更快捷高效。

(3) Sometime in the cyberpunk future, a person sits in front of a similar computer screen. This agent, however, has the benefit of a neural implant which can perform the rotation operation as fast as the computer in the previous example. The agent must still choose which internal resource to use (the implant or the good old-fashioned mental rotation), as each resource makes different demands on attention and other concurrent brain activity.

(3）在一个充满高科技与人机融合的未来世界里，一个人依偎在光影闪烁的屏幕前。这位主角身上安装了先进的神经芯片，能够像计算机一样迅速完成复杂的旋转任务。不过，即便拥有如此先进的技术，他仍然需要权衡是使用脑内植入芯片，还是依赖传统的大脑思考方式。每一种思考模式都会以不同的方式占用大脑的注意力和计算资源。

How much cognition is present in these cases? We suggest that all three cases are similar. Case (3) with the neural implant seems clearly to be on a par with case (1). And case (2) with the rotation button displays the same sort of computational structure as case (3), distributed across agent and computer instead of internalized within the agent. If the rotation in case (3) is cognitive, by what right do we count case(2) as fundamentally different? We cannot simply point to the skin/skull boundary as justification, since the legitimacy of that boundary is precisely what is at issue. But nothing else seems different.

这些情境中究竟蕴含多少智能？我们认为这三种情况实际上非常相似。第（3）种情况，通过神经植入装置，看起来明确地与第（1）种情况处于同一水平。而第（2）种情况，通过旋转按钮，展示了与第（3）种情况类似的信息处理模式 —— 只是信息处理分散在人和机器之间，而不是完全集中在个人内部。如果我们认为第（3）种情况中的旋转过程具有智能特征，那么我们凭什么说第（2）种情况本质上就完全不同呢？我们不能仅仅依赖皮肤或头骨构成的物理边界来区分，因为这个边界的意义本身就是我们正在质疑的。事实上，这些情况之间看不出实质性的差异。

The kind of case just described is by no means as exotic as it may at first appear. It is not just the presence of advanced external computing resources which raises the issue. but rather the general tendency of human reasoners to lean heavily on environmental supports. Thus consider the use of pen and paper to perform long multiplication (McClelland et al. 1986，Clark 1989)，the use of physical re-arrangements of letter tiles to prompt word recall in Scrabble(Kirsh 1995)，the use of instruments such as the nautical slide rule (Hutchins 1995), and the general paraphernalia of language, books. diagrams. and culture. In all these cases the individual brain performs some operations, while others are delegated to manipulations of external media. Had our brains been different. this distribution of tasks would doubtless have varied.

这种现象实际上并不像表面上看起来那样特别或罕见。引发这个问题的不仅仅是高级外部计算资源的存在，更重要的是人类在推理过程中普遍倾向于依靠环境辅助。例如，人们使用纸笔进行长数字乘法计算（McClelland et al. 1986，Clark 1989），在拼字游戏（Scrabble）中通过实物重新排列字母卡片来帮助回忆单词（Kirsh 1995），使用航海计算尺等专业工具（Hutchins 1995），以及借助语言、书籍、图表和文化等一般性工具。在这些情况中，人脑负责完成部分操作，而其他操作则交由外部工具来完成。如果人类大脑的构造有所不同，这种任务分工模式也必然会随之改变。

In fact. even the mental rotation cases described in scenarios (1) and (2) are real. The cases reflect options available to players of the computer game Tetris. In Tetris, falling geometric shapes must be rapidly directed into an appropriate slot in an emerging structure. A rotation button can be used. David Kirsh and Paul Maglio (1994)calculate that the physical rotation of a shape through 90 degrees takes about 100 milliseconds. plus about 200 milliseconds to select the button. To achieve the same result by mental rotation takes about 1000 milliseconds. Kirsh and Maglio go on to present compelling evidence that physical rotation is used not just to position a shape ready to fit a slot, but often to help determine whether the shape and the slot are compatible. The latter use constitutes a case of what Kirsh and Maglio call an 'epistemic action'. Epistemic actions alter the world so as to aid and augment cognitive processes such as recognition and search. Merely pragmatic actions, by contrast, alter the world because some physical change is desirable for its own sake (e.g., putting cement into a hole in a dam).

事实上，即便是场景（1）和（2）中描述的心理旋转，也并非虚构。这些案例正是来自于经典电子游戏 Tetris 中玩家的实际操作。在 Tetris 中，玩家需要快速地将下落的几何形状旋转并放置到合适的位置，以构建稳定的方块结构。

游戏研究者 David Kirsh 和 Paul Maglio 在 1994 年的研究中发现，物理旋转一个形状确实比心理旋转更有效。通过实验，他们测量得出：

- 物理旋转（90 度）需要约 100 毫秒
- 选择旋转按钮额外需要约 200 毫秒
- 相比之下，心理旋转则需要约 1000 毫秒更有趣的是，他们还发现物理旋转不仅仅是为了定位，还能帮助玩家快速判断形状是否匹配。这种通过实际操作来辅助思考的行为，被 Kirsh 和 Maglio 称为「认知行动」（Epistemic Action）。

「认知行动」指的是通过改变外部环境来协助和增强认知过程的行为，比如帮助识别、搜索或理解。这与单纯为了实现物理变化而进行的「实用行动」（Pragmatic Action）有本质区别，后者仅仅是为了达成某个直接的物理目标，如填补大坝上的裂缝。

Epistemic action, we suggest, demands spread of epistemic credit. If, as we confront some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, were it done in the head, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive process, then that part of the world is (so we claim) part of the cognitive process. Cognitive processes ain't (all) in the head!

认知活动的真正秘密，在于它可以超越大脑的边界。想象一下，当我们解决某个问题时，如果外部世界中的某些元素，如果发生在我们的头脑内，我们会毫不犹豫地认为它是思考的一部分，那么这些外部元素实际上就已经成为认知过程的组成部分了。换句话说，思考并不局限于头脑内部，它可以延伸到我们周围的世界。

### 3. Active Externalism

... By embracing an active externalism. we allow a more natural explanation of all sorts of actions. One can explain my choice of words in Scrabble, for example, as the outcome of an extended cognitive process involving the rearrangement of tiles on my tray. Of course, one could always try to explain my action in terms of internal processes and a long series of 'inputs' and 'actions', but this explanation would be needlessly complex. If an isomorphic process were going on in the head, we would feel no urge to characterize it in this cumbersome way. In a very real sense, the re- arrangement of tiles on the tray is not part of action; it is part of thought. ..

通过接纳外部世界在认知过程中的主动作用，我们可以更自然地解释人类的各种行为。比如在玩拼字游戏时，我选择单词的过程可以理解为：不断在托盘上移动和重新排列字母块，这本身就是思考的一部分。虽然我们可以用复杂的内部神经过程和信息输入来解释这一行为，但那将是没有必要的繁琐说明。就像我们的大脑在思考时会直观地组织信息一样，手上重新排列字母块恰恰是思考过程的延伸，而非与思考割裂的机械动作。

Some find this sort of externalism unpalatable. One reason may be that many identify the cognitive with the conscious, and it seems far from plausible that consciousness extends outside the head in these cases. But not every cognitive process, at least on standard usage, is a conscious process. It is widely accepted that all sorts of processes beyond the borders of consciousness play a crucial role in cognitive processing: in the retrieval of memories. linguistic processes. and skill acquisition, for example. So the mere fact that external processes are external where consciousness is internal is no reason to deny that those processes are cognitive.

一些人对这种外在主义（externalism）持反对态度。这可能是因为许多人将认知与意识画上等号，而在这些案例中，认为意识能够延伸到大脑之外这一观点似乎缺乏说服力。然而，从一般认知科学的角度来看，并非所有认知过程都是有意识的过程。科学界普遍认同，许多超出意识范围的过程在认知活动中发挥着关键作用，例如在记忆提取、语言处理和技能习得等方面。因此，仅仅因为这些过程发生在大脑之外，而意识活动发生在大脑内部，并不足以否定这些外部过程的认知属性。

More interestingly, one might argue that what keeps real cognition processes in the head is the requirement that cognitive processes be portable. Here, we are moved by a vision of what might be called the Naked Mind: a package of resources and operations we can always bring to bear on a cognitive task. regardless of the local environment. On this view. the trouble with coupled systems is that they are too easily decoupled. The true cognitive processes are those that lie at the constant core of the system; anything else is an add-on extra.

更有趣的是，有学者提出一个颇具洞见的观点：认知过程之所以必须保持在大脑内部，是因为它们需要具备「便携性」。在这里，我们被一个「纯粹心智」的理念所吸引 —— 这是一套可以不受环境限制、随时应用于认知任务的资源和操作集合。从这个角度看，与外部环境过度耦合的认知系统存在固有缺陷：它们过于脆弱，很容易因环境变化而失效。真正的认知过程应该深深扎根于系统的核心，而非依赖于外部的临时支撑。

There is something to this obiection. The brain (or brain and body) comprises a package of basic, portable, cognitive resources that is of interest in its own right. These resources may incorporate bodily actions into cognitive processes. as when we use our fingers as working memory in a tricky calculation. but they will not encompass the more contingent aspects of our external environment. such as a pocket calculator. Still. mere contingency of coupling does not rule out cognitive status. In the distant future we may be able to plug various modules into our brain to help us out: a module for extra short-term memory when we need it, for example. When a module is plugged in. the processes involving it are just as cognitive as if they had been there all along.

这个异议确实有其合理之处。大脑（或大脑与身体）本身就构成了一套基本且灵活的认知资源，这一点非常有趣。这些认知资源能够将身体动作整合到思考过程中，就像我们在解决复杂计算时使用手指辅助记忆一样。但它们并不会囊括外部环境中那些偶然出现的工具，比如袖珍计算器。

然而，仅仅因为某个工具或模块是临时连接的，就否定其认知价值是不恰当的。设想在未来，我们或许能够为大脑「插接」各种辅助模块：比如在需要时增加额外的短期记忆模块。当这样的模块被接入时，其参与的认知过程将与原本就存在的过程同样具有认知意义。

Even if one were to make the portability criterion pivotal. active externalism would not be undermined. Counting on our fingers has already been let in the door. for example. and it is easy to push things further. Think of the old image of the engineer with a slide rule hanging from his belt wherever he goes. What if people always carried a pocket calculator, or had them implanted? The real moral of the portability intuition is that for coupled systems to be relevant to the core of cognition, reliable coupling is required. It happens that most reliable coupling takes place within the brain, but there can easily be reliable coupling with the environment as well. If the resources of my calculator or my [iphone] are always there when I need them. then they are coupled with me as reliably as we need. In effect. they are part of the basic package of cognitive resources that I bring to bear on the everyday world. These systems cannot be impugned simply on the basis of the danger of discrete damage, loss, or malfunction. or because of any occasional decoupling: the biological brain is in similar danger, and occasionally loses capacities temporarily in episodes of sleep, intoxication, and emotion. If the relevant capacities are generally there when they are required. this is coupling enough.

即便我们将「可移植性」作为关键标准，主动外在认知理论也不会被颠覆。就拿我们用手指计数来说，这本身就是一个很好的例子，而且我们可以很容易地进一步拓展这一观点。想象一下老式工程师形象：无论走到哪里，腰间都挂着一个滑尺。那么，如果人们随时随地携带计算器，甚至将其植入体内，又会怎样呢？

「可移植性」背后的深层意义是：对于与认知密切相关的外部系统，关键在于它们与人类的链接是否稳定可靠。巧的是，大部分稳定链接确实发生在大脑内部，但与外部环境的稳定链接同样可行。打个比方，如果我的计算器或 iPhone 总能在我需要的时候随时为我服务，那它们就已经与我建立了足够可靠的连接，实际上已经成为我认知资源包的一部分。

不能仅仅因为这些外部系统存在损坏、丢失或故障的风险就否定它们。毕竟，我们的大脑也同样面临类似风险 —— 在睡眠、醉酒或强烈情绪状态下，它也会暂时「失灵」。只要这些资源在关键时刻能够及时到位，这种链接就是有效的。

Moreover. it may be that the biological brain has in fact evolved and matured in ways which factor in the reliable presence of a manipulable external environment. It certainly seems that evolution has favored onboard capacities which are especially geared to parasitizing the local environment so as to reduce memory load, and even to transform the nature of the computational problems themselves. Our visual systems have evolved to rely on their environment in various ways: they exploit contingent facts about the structure of natural scenes (e.g. Ullman and Richards 1984). for example, and they take advantage of the computational short cuts afforded by bodily motion and locomotion (e.g. Blake and Yuille, 1992). Perhaps there are other cases where evolution has found it advantageous to exploit the possibility of the environment being in the cognitive loop. If so, then external coupling is part of the truly basic package of cognitive resources that we bring to bear on the world.

此外，生物大脑在进化和发展过程中，很可能已经将外部环境的稳定存在作为一个重要因素。从进化的角度来看，大脑确实倾向于发展那些善于利用周围环境的能力，这些能力不仅可以减轻记忆负担，甚至能够改变计算问题的本质。我们的视觉系统在进化过程中已经形成了多种依赖环境的方式：比如，它能够利用自然场景中的固有规律（e.g. Ullman and Richards 1984），并且能够借助身体运动和位移来简化计算过程（e.g. Blake and Yuille，1992）。在其他方面，进化可能也发现了将环境纳入认知循环（cognitive loop）所带来的优势。如果确实如此，那么与外部环境的互动就是我们认知世界时所依赖的基本能力之一。

Another example may be language. which appears to be a central means by which cognitive processes are extended into the world. Think of a group of people brainstorming around a table, or a philosopher who thinks best by writing, developing her ideas as she goes. It may be that language evolved, in part, to enable such extensions of our cognitive resources within actively coupled systems.

语言可能是另一个典型的例子，它是我们将认知过程延伸到外部世界的关键方式。想象一群人围坐在桌边进行头脑风暴，或者一位哲学家通过写作来梳理思路，在书写的过程中不断完善自己的观点。语言的演化，可能部分源于帮助我们在互动和协作的系统中扩展认知资源的需求。

Within the lifetime of an organism, too, individual learning may have moulded the brain in ways that rely on cognitive extensions that surrounded us as we learned. Language is again a central example here, as are the various physical and computational artifacts that are routinely used as cognitive extensions by children in schools and by trainees in numerous professions. In such cases the brain develops in a way that complements the external structures, and learns to play its role within a unified, densely coupled system. Once we recognize that the crucial role of the environment in constraining the evolution and development of cognition, we see that extended cognition is a core cognitive process, not an add-on extra.

在生物的生命周期中，个体学习可能已经通过周围的认知扩展（Cognitive Extensions）塑造了大脑。语言是这一过程的典型代表。学校里的儿童和各专业的培训人员日常使用的物理和计算工具，同样是认知扩展的生动例证。在这些情况下，大脑会以互补的方式发展，学习在这个紧密协作的系统中发挥作用。

当我们认识到环境对认知进化和发展的关键影响时，就会发现扩展认知（Extended Cognition）并非可有可无的附加功能，而是认知过程的核心组成部分。

### 4. From Cognition to Mind

So far we have spoken largely about 'cognitive processing'. and argued for its extension into the environment. Some might think that the conclusion has been bought too cheaply. Perhaps some processing takes place in the environment, but what of mind? Everything we have said so far is compatible with the view that truly mental states-experiences, beliefs, desires, emotions, and so on- are all determined by states of the brain. Perhaps what is truly mental is internal, after all?

到目前为止，我们主要探讨了「认知加工」，并为其拓展到环境中提出了论据。但有人可能会质疑我们的结论是否太过轻易地得出。也许某些加工确实发生在环境中，但是意识怎么办呢？迄今为止，我们的讨论似乎都与这样一种观点相吻合：真正的心理状态 —— 如个人体验、信念、欲望和情感等 —— 最终都由大脑状态决定。换句话说，真正的心理活动是否只存在于大脑内部？

We propose to take things a step further. While some mental states. such as experiences, may be determined internally, there are other cases in which external factors make a significant contribution. In particular. we will argue that beliefs can be constituted partly by features of the environment, when those features play the right sort of role in driving cognitive processes. If so, the mind extends into the world.

我们希望向更深层次的思考迈进。某些心理状态，如个人体验，可能主要由内部因素决定，但在很多情况下，外部环境也会对其产生重大影响。我们特别要强调的是，当环境中的某些特征能够有效地影响和塑造思维过程时，这些特征实际上可以成为信念形成的重要组成部分。换言之，我们的心灵并非封闭在内部，而是与外部世界存在密切的互动和交融。

First, consider a normal case of belief embedded in memory. Inga hears from a friend that there is an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, and decides to go see it. She thinks for a moment and recalls that the museum is on 53rd Street. so she walks to 53rd Street and goes into the museum. It seems clear that Inga believes that the museum is on 53rd Street. and that she believed this even before she consulted her memory. It was not previously an occurrent belief, but then neither are most of our beliefs. The belief was somewhere in memory, waiting to be accessed.

首先，让我们考虑一种典型的内嵌于记忆的信念状态。Inga 从朋友那里得知现代艺术博物馆正在举办展览，并决定前往参观。她稍作思考，回忆起博物馆位于 53 街。于是，她走到 53 街并进入博物馆。显然，Inga 相信博物馆在 53 街，且这一信念早在她主动检索记忆之前就已经存在。这并非一个当下生成的信念（非现实性信念），但大多数人的信念本质上也都如此。这一信念潜藏于记忆深处，静待被提取和激活。

Now consider Otto. Otto suffers from Alzheimer's disease. and like many Alzheimer's patients. he relies on information in the environment to help structure his life. Otto carries a notebook around with him everywhere he goes. When he learns new information. he writes it down. When he needs some old information, he looks it up. For Otto, his notebook plays the role usually played by a biological memory. Today. Otto hears about the exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. and decides to go see it. He consults the notebook, which says that the museum is on 53rd Street. so he walks to 53rd Street and goes into the museum.

让我们来看看阿尔茨海默病患者奥托的生活。对于像奥托这样的患者来说，记忆是一个巨大的挑战。为了应对这一困难，奥托发明了一个独特的「外部记忆系统」—— 一本随身携带的笔记本。这本笔记本就像是他的第二个大脑，记录下生活中的每一个重要细节。当他遇到新信息时，立即记录；当需要回忆过去时，只需翻开笔记本查阅。

今天，奥托听说美术馆有一个很棒的展览，决定前往。他像往常一样查阅笔记本，找到博物馆的地址 —— 53 街。于是，他沿着笔记本的指引，自信地走向目的地。这个看似简单的行动，对阿尔茨海默病患者来说，是克服记忆障碍的一种智慧方案。

Clearly. Otto walked to 53rd Street because he wanted to go to the museum and he believed the museum was on 53rd Street. And iust as Inga had her belief even before she consulted her memory. it seems reasonable to say that Otto believed the museum was on 53rd Street even before consulting his notebook. For in relevant respects the cases are entirely analogous: the notebook plays for Otto the same role that memory plays for Inga. The information in the notebook functions just like the information constituting an ordinary non-occurrent belief: it just happens that this information lies beyond the skin.

很明确。奥托走到 53 街，是因为他想去博物馆，并且相信博物馆就在那里。这就像英格在查阅记忆之前就已经形成了某种信念一样。我们可以合理地认为，奥托在查阅笔记本之前就已经相信博物馆位于 53 街。因为在关键方面，这两种情况几乎完全相同：对于奥托来说，笔记本就相当于英格的记忆。笔记本中的信息，就像我们大脑中普通的潜在信念一样，只不过这些信息存储在身体之外。

The alternative is to say that Otto has no belief about the matter until he consults his notebook: at best. he believes that the museum is located at the address in the notebook. But if we follow Otto around for a while, we will see how unnatural this way of speaking is. Otto is constantly using his notebook as a matter of course. It is central to his actions in all sorts of contexts. in the way that an ordinary memory is central in an ordinary life. The same information might come up again and again. perhaps being slightly modified on occasion, before retreating into the recesses of his artificial memory. To say that the beliefs disappear when the notebook is filed away seems to miss the big picture in just the same way as saying that Inga's beliefs disappear as soon as she is no longer conscious of them. In both cases the information is reliably there when needed, available to consciousness and available to guide action. in just the way that we expect a belief to be.

另一种观点认为，在查阅笔记本之前，奥托对这件事一无所知 —— 顶多只知道博物馆位于笔记本记录的地址。但是，如果我们跟随奥托一段时间，就会发现这种说法有多么不自然。奥托已经将笔记本完全融入日常生活，它在各种情境中对他的行动至关重要，就像普通人的记忆在生活中扮演的核心角色一样。

同样的信息可能会反复出现，偶尔会略有变动，然后又沉淀回他的外部记忆存储中。如果说这些信息在笔记本被收起时就不复存在，这种观点就如同认为英格的记忆会随着意识的暂时消失而消失一样，都忽视了记忆的本质。在这两种情况下，信息都能在需要时可靠地被唤起，能被意识捕捉并指导行动，这正是我们对「信念」的基本期待。

Certainly. insofar as beliefs and desires are characterized by their explanatory roles. Otto's and Inga's cases seem to be on a par: the essential causal dynamics of the two cases mirror each other precisely. We are happy to explain Inga's action in terms of her occurrent desire to go to the museum and her standing belief that the museum is on 53rd street, and we should be happy to explain Otto's action in the same way. The alternative is to explain Otto's action in terms of his occurrent desire to go to the museum. his standing belief that the Museum is on the location written in the notebook. and the accessible fact that the notebook says the Museum is on 53rd Street: but this complicates the explanation unnecessarily. If we must resort to explaining Otto's action this way. then we must also do so for the countless other actions in which his notebook is involved: in each of the explanations. there will be an extra term involving the notebook. We submit that to explain things this way is to take one step too many. It is pointlessly complex, in the same way that it would be pointlessly complex to explain Inga's actions in terms of beliefs about her memory. The notebook is a constant for Otto. in the same way that memory is a constant for Inga: to point to it in every belief/desire explanation would be redundant. In an explanation, simplicity is power...

从信念和欲望的解释性作用来看，奥托和英格的案例实际上没有本质区别：两者的因果动态几乎完全相同。就像我们习惯用英格当前想去博物馆的想法和她早已知道博物馆在 53 街这个信念来解释她的行为，对奥托的行为我们也应该采用相同的解释逻辑。

另一种解释方式是强调奥托当前想去博物馆的欲望、他相信博物馆位置记录在笔记本上，以及笔记本确实写明博物馆在 53 街这一可获得的事实。但这种解释方法显得不必要地复杂。如果我们必须这样解释奥托的每一个行为，那么对于所有涉及笔记本的行动都需要如此，这将使每一个解释都增加一个与笔记本相关的额外环节。

我们认为，这种解释方式无异于画蛇添足。就像用回忆过程来解释英格的行为一样，这种复杂性是毫无意义的。对奥托而言，笔记本就像对英格的记忆一样，是一种持续稳定的认知工具。在每次解释信念和欲望时都特意指出它，纯属多余。优秀的解释应当追求简洁明了。

The moral is that when it comes to belief, there is nothing sacred about skull and skin. What makes some information count as a belief is the role it plays. and there is no reason why the relevant role can be played only from inside the body.

关键在于，信念并不局限于我们的生理边界。决定一个信息是否成为信念，取决于它在认知系统中所起的功能，而这种功能并不仅限于存在于身体内部。换言之，信息的本质不在于其物理载体，而在于它所扮演的认知角色。

Some will resist this conclusion. An opponent might put her foot down and insist that as she uses the term 'belief, or perhaps even according to standard usage, Otto simply does not qualify as believing that the museum is on 53rd Street. We do not intend to debate what is standard usage; our broader point is that the notion of belief ought to be used so that Otto qualifies as having the belief in question. In all important respects, Otto's case is similar to a standard case of (non-occurrent) belief. The differences between Otto's case and Inga's are striking, but they are superficial. By using the belief' notion in a wider way, it picks out something more akin to a natural kind. The notion becomes deeper and more unified. and is more useful in explanation.

有些人会抗拒这一结论。反对者可能会态度强硬地坚持，按照她使用「信念」这个术语，或者根据常规用法，奥托显然不符合「相信博物馆在 53 街」的信念标准。我们无意争论什么是标准用法；我们的更广泛观点是，应当以一种更包容的方式理解「信念」概念，使得奥托能够被视为拥有相关信念。在所有重要方面，奥托的情况与典型的潜在性信念（non-occurrent belief）极为相似。奥托和英格的情况看似存在显著差异，但这些差异实际上是表面的。通过拓展「信念」的概念内涵，我们能够捕捉到更接近本质的认知特征。这种概念界定使得信念理解更加深入、统一，并在认知解释中更具洞察力。

To provide substantial resistance. an opponent has to show that Otto's and Inga's cases differ in some important and relevant respect. But in what deep respect are the cases different? To make the case solely on the grounds that information is in the head in one case but not in the other would be to beg the question. If this difference is relevant to a difference in belief, it is surely not primitively relevant. To justify the different treatment. we must find some more basic underlying difference between the two.

要对这个观点提出有力的反驳，对手必须证明 Otto 和 Inga 的案例在某些关键方面存在实质性差异。但问题是，这两个案例究竟在哪些深层次的方面真正不同？仅仅说明信息在一种情况下存在于头脑中而在另一种情况下不存在，这种论证本身就陷入了循环论证的陷阱。如果这种差异与信念的差异有关，那么这种关联必定不是直接的或本质的。为了正当化不同的处理方式，我们必须找出这两种情况更为根本的潜在区别。

It might be suggested that the cases are relevantly different in that Inga has more reliable access to the information. After all. someone might take away Otto's notebook at any time. but Inga's memory is safer. It is not implausible that constancy is relevant: indeed, the fact that Otto always uses his notebook played some role in our justifying its cognitive status. If Otto were consulting a guidebook as a one-off, we would be much less likely to ascribe him a standing belief. But in the original case, Otto's access to the notebook is very reliable not perfectly reliable. to be sure. but then neither is Inga's access to her memory. A surgeon might tamper with her brain. or more mundanely, she might have too much to drink. The mere possibility of such tampering is not enough to deny her the belief.

有人或许会争论，Inga 和 Otto 的案例存在关键差异，主要在于 Inga 获取信息的方式更为可靠。毕竟，Otto 的笔记本随时可能被人拿走，而 Inga 的记忆相对更加安全。信念的持续性确实可能很重要：Otto 始终依赖笔记本这一事实，在证明其认知地位时发挥了一定作用。如果 Otto 仅偶尔查阅指南，我们不太可能认为他拥有稳定的信念。

在原始场景中，Otto 获取笔记本的途径相当可靠 —— 虽然并非绝对完美，但同样，Inga 获取记忆的途径也并非百分之百安全。外科医生可能会干预她的大脑，或者更平常地说，她可能会喝得太醉。仅仅存在这种潜在的干预可能性，并不足以否认她的信念。

One might worry that Otto's access to his notebook in fact comes and goes. He showers without the notebook, for example, and he cannot read it when it is dark. Surely his belief cannot come and go so easily? We could get around this problem by re-describing the situation. but in any case an occasional temporary disconnection does not threaten our claim. After all. when Inga is asleep. or when she is intoxicated. we do not say that her belief disappears. What really counts is that the information is easily available when the subiect needs it. and this constraint is satisfied equally in the two cases. If Otto's notebook were often unavailable to him at times when the information in it would be useful, there might be a problem, as the information would not be able to play the action-guiding role that is central to belief: but if it is easily available in most relevant situations. the belief is not endangered. Perhaps a difference is that Inga has better access to the information than Otto does? Inga's 'central' processes and her memory probably have a relatively high-bandwidth link between them. compared to the low-grade connection between Otto and his notebook. But this alone does not make a difference between believing and not believing. Consider Inga's museum-going friend Lucy, whose biological memory has only a low-grade link to her central systems, due to nonstandard biology or past misadventures. Processing in Lucy's case might be less efficient. but as long as the relevant information is accessible. Lucy clearly believes that the museum is on 53rd Street. If the connection was too indirect-if Lucy had to struggle hard to retrieve the information with mixed results, or a psychotherapist's aid were needed-we might become more reluctant to ascribe the belief. but such cases are well bevond Otto's situation, in which the information is easily accessible.

人们可能会担心，Otto 获取笔记本信息并不总是那么方便。比如，他洗澡时无法查看笔记本，夜晚也看不清内容。那么，他的「信念」难道会如此轻易地出现又消失吗？

这个问题其实并不复杂。就像 Inga 睡觉或喝醉时，我们并不认为她的记忆和信念就此消失一样。关键在于：信息是否能在需要时被方便地检索。

假设 Otto 的笔记本经常在关键时刻不可用，那确实会影响他对信息的「信念」。但只要大多数情况下他都能轻松获取信息，这种认知模式就是有效的。

或许有人会说，Inga 的记忆系统比 Otto 的笔记本更直接、更高效。Inga 的大脑可以快速调用信息，而 Otto 需要翻阅笔记本。但这种差异本身并不意味着 Otto 就没有真正的「信念」。

让我们再举个例子。Inga 的朋友 Lucy 由于生理原因，她的记忆系统与大脑中枢的连接非常迟缓。尽管如此，当 Lucy 能够回忆起博物馆的地址时，我们依然会说她「相信」博物馆在 53 街。

唯一需要注意的是，如果检索信息变得极其困难 —— 比如需要心理治疗师帮助才能回忆，那么我们可能会质疑这是否算作真正的「信念」。但 Otto 的情况显然不是如此 —— 他的笔记本信息始终清晰可得。

Another suggestion could be that Otto has access to the relevant information only by perception, whereas Inga has more direct access -by introspection. perhaps. In some ways, however, to put things this way is to beg the question. After all. we are in effect advocating a point of view on which Otto's internal processes and his notebook constitute a single cognitive system. From the standpoint of this system. the flow of information between notebook and brain is not perceptual at all: it does not involve the impact of something outside the system. It is more akin to information flow within the brain. The only deep way in which the access is perceptual is that in Otto's case. there is a distinctly perceptual phenomenology associated with the retrieval of the information. whereas in Inga's case there is not. But why should the nature of an associated phenomenology make a difference to the status of a belief? Inga's memory may have some associated phenomenology, but it is still a belief. The phenomenology is not visual. to be sure. But for visual phenomenology consider the Terminator. from the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie of the same name. When he recalls some information from memory, it is 'displayed' before him in his visual field (presumably he is conscious of it, as there are frequent shots depicting his point of view). The fact that standing memories are recalled in this unusual way surely makes little difference to their status as standing beliefs.

另一种观点是，Otto 只能通过感知获取相关信息，而 Inga 则可以通过内省更直接地获取信息。然而，这种说法本身可能存在问题。实际上，我们正在阐述这样一个观点：Otto 的内部认知过程和他的笔记本共同构成了一个统一的认知系统。从这个系统的角度看，笔记本和大脑之间的信息传递并非外部感知，而更像是大脑内部的信息流动。

唯一深层次的感知差异在于，Otto 检索信息时存在明显的感知现象学特征，而 Inga 则没有。但是，为什么这种现象学特征会影响信念的本质？Inga 的记忆虽然可能缺乏视觉现象学，但仍然是一种信念。

为了说明这一点，不妨看看电影《终结者》中阿诺德·施瓦辛格饰演的机器人。当他从记忆中调取信息时，这些信息会在他的视觉域中「显示」出来。尽管这种信息检索方式看似非同寻常，但它并不会改变这些记忆作为基础信念的本质。

These various small differences between Otto's and Inga's cases are all shallow differences. To focus on them would be to miss the way in which for Otto. notebook entries play just the sort of role that beliefs play in guiding most people's lives.

这些奥托和英格案例中的细微差异实际上都不太重要。如果过分关注这些细枝末节，就会忽略了一个关键点：对于奥托来说，他的笔记本条目与常人的记忆和信念发挥着完全相同的功能和作用。

Perhaps the intuition that Otto's is not a true belief comes from a residual feeling that the only true beliefs are occurrent beliefs. If we take this feeling seriously. Inga's belief will be ruled out too. as will many beliefs that we attribute in everyday life. This would be an extreme view. but it may be the most consistent way to deny Otto's belief. Upon even a slightly less extreme view the view that a belief must be available for consciousness. for example Otto's notebook entry seems to qualify just as well as Inga's memory. Once dispositional beliefs are let in the door. it is difficult to resist the conclusion that Otto's notebook has all the relevant dispositions.

或许，认为奥托没有真正信念的直觉源于这样一种潜意识：只有当下意识中的信念才是真正的信念。如果我们严肃地看待这种观点，不仅奥托的信念会被排除，英格的信念以及我们日常生活中归因的许多信念也都将被否定。这确实是一个极端的观点，但可能是否认奥托拥有信念的最一致方式。

即便采用稍微不那么极端的观点 —— 即信念必须能被意识捕捉，奥托的笔记本条目似乎也和英格的记忆同样具有信念的资格。一旦我们承认隐性或潜在的信念存在，就很难否认奥托的笔记本具备了构成信念所需的全部相关特征。

### 5. Bevond the Outer Limits

If the thesis is accepted, how far should we go? All sorts of puzzle cases spring to mind. What of the amnesic villagers in One Hundred Years of Solitude, who forget the names for everything and so hang labels everywhere? Does the information in my [iphone] count as part of my memory? If Otto's notebook has been tampered with. does he believe the newly installed information? Do I believe the contents of the page in front of me before I read it? Is my cognitive state somehow spread across the Internet?

如果这个理论被接受，我们究竟可以走多远？各种令人啼笑皆非的边界案例瞬间涌上心头。比如在马尔克斯的《百年孤独》中，那些被遗忘魔咒笼罩的村民，他们不记得任何事物的名称，只好在周遭事物上到处张贴标签，以维持与世界的最后联系。我的智能手机里储存的信息，是否已经成为记忆的一部分？如果奥托的笔记本被人动了手脚，他还会相信新灌输的信息吗？在阅读眼前这页纸之前，我是否已经相信了其内容？我的认知状态是否已经悄然延伸至浩瀚的互联网？

We do not think that there are categorical answers to all of these questions. and we will not give them. But to help understand what is involved in ascriptions of extended belief. we can at least examine the features of our central case that make the notion so clearly applicable there. First, the notebook is a constant in Otto's life-in cases where the information in the notebook would be relevant, he will rarely take action without consulting it. Second, the information in the notebook is directly available without difficulty. Third, upon retrieving information from the notebook he automatically endorses it. Fourth. the information in the notebook has been consciously endorsed at some point in the past, and indeed is there as a consequence of this endorsement.[2] The status of the fourth feature as a criterion for belief is arguable (perhaps one can acquire beliefs through subliminal perception, or through memory tampering?), but the first three features certainly play a crucial role.

我们并不认为这些问题有绝对的答案，也不打算给出明确的结论。但为了帮助理解什么是「扩展信念」（extended belief），我们至少可以分析一个典型案例，解释为什么这个概念在这里如此清晰。

以 Otto 为例，他的笔记本在生活中扮演着特殊的角色：首先，在需要相关信息的情况下，他几乎总是会先查阅笔记本，然后再决定行动。其次，笔记本里的信息随时可以轻松获取。第三，每当他从笔记本中查找信息时，都会不假思索地接受这些信息。

第四个特点是，笔记本中的信息在过去曾经被他有意识地认可，并因此被记录下来。当然，这一特征作为判断信念的标准是有争议的 —— 比如，人们是否可以通过潜意识感知或记忆重塑来获得信念？但前三个特征无疑对理解「扩展信念」至关重要。

[2] The constancy and past-endorsement criteria may suggest that history is partly constitutive of belief. One might react to this by removing any historical component (giving a purely dispositional reading of the constancy criterion and eliminating the past-endorsement criterion, for example), or one might allow such a component as long as the main burden is carried by features of the present.

[2] 对于信念的形成，有两个重要的判断标准：信念的持续性和过去的认可程度。这些标准暗示，一个人的历史经历可能在塑造当前信念中扮演重要角色。面对这一观点，学者们可能会有两种不同的态度：要么完全排除历史因素的影响，采用纯粹的心理倾向性解释；要么承认历史的作用，但更侧重于当下的实际情况和特征。

Insofar as increasingly exotic puzzle cases lack these features. the applicability of the notion of 'belief gradually falls of. If I rarely take relevant action without consulting my [iphone], for example, its status within my cognitive system will resemble that of the notebook in Otto's. But if I often act without consultation for example. if I sometimes answer relevant questions with 'I don't know'- then information in it counts less clearly as part of my belief system. The Internet is likely to fail on multiple counts, unless I am unusually computer-reliant, facile with the technology, and trusting, but information in certain files on my computer may qualify. In intermediate cases, the question of whether a belief is present may be indeterminate, or the answer may depend on the varying standards that are at play in various contexts in which the question might be asked. But any indeterminacy here does not mean that in the central cases, the answer is not clear.

随着解决复杂问题的场景越来越多样，「信念」这个概念的适用范围也在不断变化。打个比方，如果一个人总是依赖手机来获取信息和做决定，那么这部手机就像是他思考和记忆的延伸。就像哲学家 Otto 曾经用笔记本辅助记忆一样。

但如果有时不查手机就能做出判断，或者对某些问题干脆回答「我不知道」，那么手机中的信息就不再那么确定地属于个人的信念系统了。同理，互联网上的信息也是如此 —— 除非一个人特别依赖计算机、熟悉技术并且高度信任。相比之下，个人电脑中的某些文件可能更可靠。

在很多情况下，什么算作「真正的信念」其实是很难界定的。不同的场景、不同的语境可能会导致不同的判断标准。但这并不意味着我们无法在核心情况下做出清晰的判断。

What about socially extended cognition? Could my mental states be partly constituted by the states of other thinkers? We see no reason why not, in principle. In an unusually interdependent couple, it is entirely possible that one partner's beliefs will play the same sort of role for the other as the notebook plays for Otto. What is central is a high degree of trust, reliance, and accessibility. In other social relationships these criteria may not be so clearly fulfilled, but they might nevertheless be fulfilled in specific domains. For example, the waiter at my favorite restaurant might act as a repository of my beliefs about my favorite meals (this might even be construed as a case of extended desire). In other cases. one's beliefs might be embodied in one's secretary, one's accountant, or one's collaborator.

社会性认知扩展理论提出了一个有趣的哲学问题：我们的心理状态是否可以部分由其他个体的认知状态构成？从原则上讲，这种可能性是存在的。

以高度依赖和信任的伴侣关系为例，一方的信念完全可能对另一方发挥类似外部认知辅助工具（如著名的奥托备忘录）的作用。这种认知扩展的关键在于建立在高度信任、相互依赖和便捷获取的基础之上。

虽然在普通的社会关系中，这种认知扩展可能不那么明显，但在特定领域仍然可能存在。比如，在你常去的餐馆里，一位熟悉的服务员可能已经成为你饮食偏好的「活的记忆库」。这种情况甚至可以被理解为一种扩展的个人偏好或欲望。

更进一步，我们的认知可能会延伸到秘书、会计，乃至密切合作的同事。他们不仅仅是信息的载体，更可能成为我们认知网络中不可或缺的一部分。

In each of these cases, the major burden of the coupling between agents is carried by language. Without language, we might be much more akin to discrete Cartesian 'inner' minds. in which high-level cognition relies largely on internal resources. But the advent of language has allowed us to spread this burden into the world. Language, thus construed, is not a mirror of our inner states but a complement to them. It serves as a tool whose role is to extend cognition in ways that on-board devices cannot. Indeed, it may be that the intellectual explosion in recent evolutionary time is due as much to this linguistically-enabled extension of cognition as to any independent development in our inner cognitive resources.

在每一种情境中，语言都承担了人与人之间交流和认知互动的主要桥梁。若没有语言，我们可能更像是彼此隔绝的个体，高层认知主要局限于个人内部。语言的出现，使我们得以将思维的边界向外延伸。在这个意义上，语言不仅仅反映内心世界，更是内心思维的有力补充。它犹如一个强大的工具，能以独特的方式拓展认知，突破个人思维的局限。事实上，人类最近进化阶段的智力飞跃，很可能源于这种通过语言实现的认知扩展，而非仅仅依赖个体内在认知能力的提升。

What, finally, of the self? Does the extended mind imply an extended self? It seems so. Most of us already accept that the self outstrips the boundaries of consciousness: my dispositional beliefs, for example, constitute in some deep sense part of who I am. If so. then these boundaries may also fall beyond the skin. The information in Otto's notebook, for example, is a central part of his identity as a cognitive agent. What this comes to is that Otto himself is best regarded as an extended system, a coupling of biological organism and external resources. To consistently resist this conclusion, we would have to shrink the self into a mere bundle of occurrent states. severely threatening its deep psychological continuity. Far better to take the broader view, and see agents themselves as spread into the world

什么是自我的本质？扩展思维是否意味着自我也随之扩展？这个答案似乎是肯定的。大多数人已经认识到，自我并不局限于意识范畴：比如，我潜在的信念和观点在某种深层意义上塑造了我的身份。如果承认这一点，那么自我的边界就很可能延伸到身体之外。以患有阿尔茨海默症的奥托为例，他笔记本里的信息已经成为他认知身份不可或缺的部分。这表明，奥托可以被视为一个更加开放的系统，由生物个体和外部资源共同构成。如果我们执意将自我局限于狭隘的当下状态，就会严重破坏个人的心理连续性。不如以更开放的视角看待个体：我们其实是与周围世界息息相关、不断互动的存在。

As with any reconception of ourselves. this view will have significant consequences. There are obvious consequences for philosophical views of the mind and for the methodology of research in cognitive science, but there will also be effects in the moral and social domains. It may be, for example, that in some cases interfering with someone's environment will have the same moral significance as interfering with their person. And if the view is taken seriously, certain forms of social activity might be reonceived as less akin to communication and action. and as more akin to thought. In any case, once the hegemony of skin and skull is usurped, we may be able to see ourselves more truly as creatures of the world.

像其他自我重新定义的观点一样，这种视角将带来深远的影响。这不仅对心灵的哲学理解和认知科学研究方法具有重要意义，还将在道德和社会层面产生深刻的影响。比如，在某些情况下，干预一个人的环境可能会被赋予与直接干预个人同等的道德分量。如果认真看待这一观点，某些社会活动可能会被重新诠释：不再仅仅是交流和行动，而更多地被视为一种思考过程。总的来说，一旦突破了以个人身体为中心的传统局限，我们或许能更加真实地认识自己：我们是与世界紧密交织的生命个体。
