Programming is an interesting field since it gives us the superpower to control computer systems. It can be used in airplanes, traffic control, robots, self-driving cars, websites, mobile apps, and for a ton of other use cases. Now the main thing is that software engineers have created several programming languages, and each of them is suitable to solve a different problem.

Today, I’m gonna share with you some websites and blogs that write about different programming languages and the best practices when using them. This list is in no particular order — all of them are great reads!

1『很有价值的资源池。』

## 01. The hackr.io Blog

[Hackr.io Blog - Best practices and Insights for Programmers & Designers](https://hackr.io/blog)

hackr.io is basically a website where people recommend programming courses, and the best one ranks to the top. The reason behind mentioning this blog is their team regularly publishes interesting tutorials and informational guides for software developers.

For example, you can learn about mobile and web development frameworks, Java projects, software testing, interview questions, and much more. But remember they write about a completely different topic every time they publish an article. So it might not be the best blog to follow if you’re interested in a specific programming language.

## 02. Better Programming

[Better Programming – Medium](https://medium.com/better-programming)

Better Programming is a Medium publication dedicated to programming. They publish multiple articles every day from multiple authors, all curated and edited to guarantee excellent content and great reads.

They cover a variety of topics and programming languages, with content for both beginners and very advanced readers. It’s a must-have on your daily ingest if you want to develop your programming skills.

Full disclosure, I’m a regular writer at Better Programming, but I was a reader for a long time before I started generating my own content. I was extremely happy when I got the chance the publish my articles with them.

## 03. DEV

[DEV Community](https://dev.to/)

Collaboration plays a key role in developing high-quality software. That’s the sole reason behind the existence of the DEV community. It enables software developers to share their knowledge with the whole world by posting informational articles. I’d personally recommend you regularly visit this website to keep an eye on what’s going on in the development field.

A great thing about DEV is their website code is completely open-source. This means you can easily have a look at the source code that powers this amazing website.

## 04. Hacker Noon

[Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/)

Just like DEV, Hacker Noon is also a community-run website. It has more than 7,000 active contributors that write on diverse but relevant topics for software developers. It focuses on things like programming, startups, technology, entrepreneurship, business, marketing, etc.

In my opinion, we developers aren’t familiar enough with the business side of software and technology. So Hacker Noon can be a great platform to learn programming and how to earn money from it.

## 05. Live Code Stream

[Live Code Stream | Articles on Javascript, Python, AI and more...](https://livecodestream.dev/)

This is a blog of my own creation. It’s dedicated to programming and AI and was built to share my development experience with you. You’ll see me writing about artificial intelligence, programming (mostly Python and JavaScript), machine learning, and the best way to use them in projects.

1『作者自己的博客。』

The site is optimized for loading speed and reading comfort, offering a dark mode for those who prefer that.

Actually, unlike many other bloggers, I used a static-site generator called Hugo to generate this website. Its major advantage is speed as compared to a CMS like WordPress. I’ve created a tutorial on static hosting with AWS and user-friendly URLs.

## 06. David Walsh Blog (DWB)

[David Walsh Blog - JavaScript Consultant](https://davidwalsh.name/)

David Walsh is a very popular blogger within the developer community. Basically, he’s a software engineer who works at the tech giant Mozilla. If you’ve ever tried to learn about web development, then you might come across the step-by-step documentation provided by the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) . David Walsh is the one who mostly enhanced that website.

So considering his knowledge and experience in the web development field, you’ll definitely learn a lot from his blog.

## 07. Droids On Roids Blog

[Blog about Mobile & Web App Development – Droids On Roids](https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog)

Want to learn mobile-application development? This blog regularly publishes best practices and how-to guides for beginners. It’ll help you understand the importance of creating great user experiences.

They have articles about Android, iOS, Flutter, and many other app-development frameworks or tools. So follow them to stay aware of the latest mobile-development trends.

## 08. Real Python

[Python Tutorials – Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

Python is no doubt an all-seasons language — meaning you can develop mobile apps, games, websites, embedded applications, and even machine learning projects using Python. As its name suggests, Real Python is a website completely focused on delivering high-quality tutorials and courses on the Python programming language.

These days, Python is also taught as a first programming language in different schools throughout the world. In case you’re also getting started, then I’d highly recommend you to visit this website and follow their step-by-step guides.

## 09. Golang Programs

[Golang Tutorial, Blog, Articles and Examples - golangprograms.com](https://www.golangprograms.com/)

Go is a programming language that was designed by the smart software engineers of Google. Its performance is way better than most high-level programming languages. That’s the reason why programmers love to add Go to their tech stack.

If you’re someone who’s completely new to Go, then this website will help you get started quickly. They have a beginner-friendly tutorial series and references written by professionals. Every now and then, you’ll also see examples and solutions to different problems, which are a great way to learn about the real-world implementation of the Go programming language.

## 10. Stack Abuse

[Stack Abuse](https://stackabuse.com/)

Stack Abuse mainly focuses on topics like Python, JavaScript, Java, and the Unix operating system. It’s managed by Scott Robinson with a team of content writers. They usually publish how-to guides and teach you through example code snippets.

It’ll be a useful resource to learn project-based concepts. But before that, you must have some familiarity with the basics of JavaScript, Python, and Java.

## Conclusion

As a beginner, learning a programming language can become a daunting task. So the main purpose of writing this article is to introduce you to interesting programming blogs. Now, it’s your turn to follow these websites and bring your programming skills to the next level.
