Keywords: attention, central executive, phonological loop, episodic buffer, visuo-spatial sketchpad, short-term memory

### Abstract

I present an account of the origins and development of the multicomponent approach to working memory, making a distinction between the overall theoretical framework, which has remained relatively stable, and the attempts to build more specific models within this framework.

I follow this with a brief discussion of alternative models and their relationship to the framework. I conclude with speculations on further developments and a comment on the value of attempting to apply models and theories beyond the laboratory studies on which they are typically based.

本文介绍了工作记忆多组成部分理论的起源与发展。本文首先区分了理论的总体框架和在这一框架下构建的更为具体的模型之间的差异，前者保持了相对的稳定性，而后者则体现了在此理论基础上的深入探索与尝试。

紧接着，文章简要分析了其他模型与该框架之间的联系与差异。最后，文章对未来可能的发展方向进行了展望，并对在实验室研究基础上将这些模型和理论应用到更广泛领域的尝试价值进行了探讨。

WORKING MEMORY: THEORIES, MODELS, AND CONTROVERSIES

I was honored, pleased, and challenged by the invitation to write this prefatory chapter, pleased because it offered the chance to take a broad and somewhat autobiographical view of my principal area of interest, working memory (WM), but challenged by the potential magnitude of the task. The topic of working memory has increased dramatically in citation counts since the early years, not all of course related to or supportive of my own work, but a recent attempt to review it (Baddeley 2007) ended with more than 50 pages of references. What follows is a partial, as opposed to impartial, account of the origins of the concept of multicomponent working memory (M-WM) and of my own views on its subsequent development. My first draft would have filled the chapter page allowance with references; I apologize to all of those whose work should have been cited and is not.

I entered psychology as a student at University College London in 1953, a very exciting time for the field of psychology, which had benefited greatly from developments during the Second World War, where theory was enriched by the need to tackle practical problems.

As a result, prewar issues such as the conflict between Gestalt psychology and neobehaviorism began to be challenged by new data and new ideas, some based on cybernetics, the study of control systems, with others influenced by the newly developed digital computers. This in turn led to a renewed interest in the philosophy of science as applied to psychology. Typical questions included, is psychology a science? if so, is it cumulative or are we doomed to keep on asking the same questions, as appeared to be the case in philosophy? What would a good psychological theory look like?

As students we were offered two answers to this question. The first, championed by Cambridge philosopher Richard Braithwaite (1953), regarded Newton's Principia as the model to which scientific theories should aspire, involving as it does postulates, laws, equations, and predictions. Within psychology, the Newtonian model was explicitly copied by Clark Hull in his attempt to produce a general theory of learning, principally based on the study of maze learning in the albino rat.

撰写这篇序言对我而言既是荣誉，也是挑战。它不仅让我有机会广泛且从个人经历的角度回顾我最感兴趣的领域 —— 工作记忆，同时也让我面临这一任务的庞大挑战。尽管工作记忆这个话题自早期以来在引用量上急剧增加，其中不乏对我的工作的引用和支持，但是当我尝试回顾此领域时（Baddeley 2007），仅参考文献就超过了 50 页。这里我将分享关于多组分工作记忆概念起源以及我对其发展的看法的一部分视角，这是出于个人立场而非完全客观的叙述。我的初稿中引用的文献量巨大，足以填满整个章节，对于那些应被引用但未被提及的研究，我在此表示歉意。

我在 1953 年作为学生加入了伦敦大学学院心理学系，那是一个对心理学领域极为激动人心的时期。心理学从二战期间的发展中获得了巨大的益处，理论的丰富源于解决实际问题的需求。

这导致了战前一些问题，如格式塔心理学与新行为主义之间的冲突，开始受到新数据和新理念的挑战。这些新思想一部分基于控制论（研究控制系统的学科），另一部分受到了新开发的数字计算机的影响。这也重新点燃了对心理学中应用科学哲学的兴趣。人们开始探讨心理学是否为一门科学，如果是，它是累积性的还是我们注定要反复探讨相同的问题，正如在哲学中所发生的那样？一个优秀的心理学理论应该是怎样的？

我们得到了两种回答。第一种，由剑桥哲学家 Richard Braithwaite 在 1953 年提出，他认为牛顿的《原理》应是科学理论的典范，包含了假设、定律、方程和预测。在心理学领域，Clark Hull 尝试通过研究白鼠的迷宫学习来构建一个一般性的学习理论，这一尝试明确地复制了牛顿模型。

An alternative model of theorizing came from Oxford, where Stephen Toulmin (1953) argued that theories were like maps, ways of organizing our existing knowledge of the world, providing tools both for interacting with the world and for further exploration. Edward Tolman in Stanford had a view of learning in rats that fitted this model, using it to challenge Hull's neo-behaviorist approach. This raised the crucial question as to how you might decide between the two apparently opposing views. The dominant answer to that question, in the United Kingdom at least, was provided by Karl Popper (1959), a Viennese-trained philosopher who argued strongly that a valid theory should make clear, testable predictions, allowing the rival theories to confront each other in the all-important "crucial experiment" that settles the issue. This approach was closer in spirit to Hull than to Tolman.

My own first published study (Baddeley 1960) attempted just such a crucial experiment, predicting that rats would be smarter than they should be according to Hullian theory, and demonstrating, to my own satisfaction at least, that this was the case. Alas, by the time it was published, the whole field of learning theory seemed to have collapsed. Neither side was able to deliver a knockout blow, and people simply abandoned the research area. I resolved at that point that if I myself were to develop a theory, it would be based very closely on the evidence, which would survive even if the theory proved totally wrong. It is an approach I have followed ever since.

But what is the answer to our original question, should theorists be architects, building elegant structures such as Newton did, or should they be explorers, gradually extending the theory on the basis of more and more evidence, as in the case of Darwin? Clearly both Newton and Darwin got it right, but for fields at a different stage of development. Newton claimed that his success resulted from "standing on the shoulders of giants," who no doubt stood on the shoulders of lesser mortals like ourselves. Darwin had few such giants available. I suggest that any complete theory is likely to require explorers in its initial stages and architects to turn the broad concepts into detailed models. I myself am very much at the explorer end of the continuum, but I fully accept the importance of the skills of the architect if theory is to develop.

另一种理论化思路源自牛津，Stephen Toulmin（1953）提出，理论犹如地图，是我们组织对世界知识认知的方式，不仅为我们与世界互动提供了工具，也为进一步的探索提供了可能。而在斯坦福，Edward Tolman 就老鼠的学习提出了一个符合此模型的观点，他使用这一模型挑战了 Hull 的新行为主义方法。这引发了一个关键问题：如何在两种看似对立的观点之间做出选择。在英国，至少，对这个问题的主流回答是由 Karl Popper（1959）提出的。作为一名接受维也纳训练的哲学家，他强调，一个有效的理论应当能够提出清晰且可测试的预测，让相互竞争的理论在决定性的实验中直面对抗，从而解决争议。这种方法在精神上更靠近 Hull 而非 Tolman。

我的第一项公开发表的研究（Baddeley 1960）正是尝试进行这样一项决定性实验，预测老鼠的智力会超出 Hull 理论的预期，并至少在我自己看来，证明了这一点。遗憾的是，当这项研究发表时，整个学习理论领域似乎已经陷入崩溃。两方都未能达成决定性的胜利，研究领域因此被遗弃。我那时决定，如果我要发展自己的理论，它必须紧紧基于证据，即便理论最终被彻底推翻，这些证据也能够存留。这是一种我此后一直坚持的方法。

但对于我们最初的问题，理论家应当成为建筑师，构建像牛顿那样的优雅结构，还是应当作为探索者，像达尔文那样在更多证据基础上逐步扩展理论呢？显然，牛顿和达尔文都正确了，但他们适用于处于不同发展阶段的领域。牛顿自称其成功是因为「站在巨人的肩膀上」，这些巨人无疑又是站在像我们这样的凡人肩膀上的。而达尔文可用的这样的巨人并不多。我认为，任何完整的理论在初期阶段都需要探索者，以及需要建筑师将广阔的概念转化为详细模型。我自认更偏向于探索者，但我完全认可，如果理论要得到发展，建筑师的技艺同样重要。

My research career really began with my arrival at the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Unit (APU) in Cambridge. Its role was to form a bridge between psychological theory and practical problems, and the year I arrived, Donald Broadbent, its director, had just published his seminal book, Perception and Communication, which provided one of the sparks that ignited what subsequently became known as the cognitive revolution. I was assigned to work on optimizing the design of postal codes, which led me to combine the classic tradition of nonsense syllable learning with new ideas from information theory, resulting in my generating memorable postal codes for each town in the United Kingdom. The Post Office thanked me and went on their way regardless; the code they adopted could, however, have been much worse, as is indeed the case in some countries, but that is another story.

By this time my approach to theory was evolving away from Popper's idea of the need for crucial experiments, largely on the grounds that clear predictions only appeared to be possible in situations that were far narrower than the ones I found interesting. I subsequently discovered that within the philosophy of science, Lakatos (1976), and allegedly Popper himself, had subsequently abandoned the reliance on falsification, arguing instead that the mark of a good theory is that it should be productive, not only giving an account of existing knowledge, but also generating fruitful questions that will increase our knowledge. This more map-like view of theory is the one that I continue to take.

我的研究生涯的开端是我加入了位于剑桥的医学研究委员会应用心理学单位（APU），一个旨在将心理学理论与实践问题联系起来的机构。我到达的那一年，单位主任 Donald Broadbent 刚发布了他的开创性著作《感知与沟通》，该书成为了后来所称认知革命的一把火花。我负责的任务是优化邮政编码的设计，这个任务将我对无意义音节学习的经典研究与信息理论的新思想相结合，最终我为英国每个城镇设计了易于记忆的邮政编码。尽管邮政局对此表示了感谢，但他们最终选择的编码系统还是与我提出的有所不同；虽然他们的选择比某些国家的情况要好，但这已经是另外一个故事了。

随着时间的推移，我对理论的方法开始从 Popper 所强调的需要决定性实验的观点演变。主要原因是，在我感兴趣的广泛领域内，清晰的预测似乎只能在更为狭窄的情境中做出。后来，我发现科学哲学领域内，Lakatos（1976 年），乃至 Popper 本人，都逐渐摒弃了对反证法的依赖，转而认为一个理论的优势在于其生产力 —— 不仅能解释已有的知识，还能提出能够拓展我们知识边界的有益问题。这种将理论视为知识地图的观点，是我持续采纳的视角。

#### Short-Term Memory

The term "working memory" evolved from the earlier concept of short-term memory (STM), and the two are still on occasion used interchangeably. I will use STM to refer to the simple temporary storage of information, in contrast to WM, which implies a combination of storage and manipulation.

My interest in STM began during my time at the APU in Cambridge and was prompted by an applied problem, that of finding a way of evaluating the quality of telephone lines that might be more effective than a simple listening test. My PhD supervisor Conrad had recently discovered the acoustic similarity effect. He was studying memory for proposed telephone dialing codes when he noted that even with visual presentation, memory errors resembled acoustic mis-hearing errors (e.g., v for b), and that memory for similar sequences (b g t p c) was poorer than for dissimilar (k r l q y), concluding that STM depends on an acoustic code (Conrad & Hull 1964).

I decided to see if the acoustic similarity effect could be used to provide sensitive indirect measure of telephone line quality. It did not; the effects of noise and similarity were simply additive, but I was intrigued by the sheer magnitude of the similarity effect. Similarity was a central variable within the dominant stimulusresponse interference theory of verbal learning (see Osgood 1949), but the type of similarity seemed not to be regarded as important. So, would Conrad's effect generalize to other types of similarity in STM?

「工作记忆」一词是从更早的「短期记忆」（STM）概念演化而来的，尽管两者在某些情况下仍可以交替使用。在这里，我将「短期记忆」定义为信息的简单临时存储，而「工作记忆」则涉及到信息存储与处理的结合。

我的对短期记忆的兴趣源于我在剑桥的医学研究委员会应用心理学单位（APU）工作期间，起因是一个实际问题：探索一种评估电话线路质量的方法，这种方法希望能比传统的听力测试更为有效。我的博士导师 Conrad 最近揭示了声学相似性效应。在研究推荐的电话拨号码记忆时，他发现即便是通过视觉呈现，记忆错误也倾向于与声音误听（例如，将 v 听成 b）类似，对于声学上相似的序列（如 b g t p c）的记忆表现不如声学上不相似的序列（如 k r l q y），从而得出结论，短期记忆依赖于声学编码（Conrad & Hull 1964）。

我想要探究声学相似性效应是否能成为评估电话线质量的一个敏感而间接的指标。结果并非如预期，噪音和相似性的效应只是简单相加，但相似性效应的显著程度引起了我的极大兴趣。在当时主流的口头学习的刺激-反应干扰理论中，相似性是一个核心变量（参见 Osgood 1949），但对相似性类型的重要性却未受到足够重视。因此，我开始思考 Conrad 所发现的效应是否可以扩展到短期记忆中其它类型的相似性。

I tested this, comparing recall of sequences with five phonologically similar words (man, mat, can, map, cat), five dissimilar words (e.g., pit, day, cow, pen, sup), and five semantically similar sequences (huge, big, wide, large, tall ) with five dissimilar (wet, soft, old, late, good ). I found (Baddeley 1966a) a huge effect of phonological similarity1 (80% sequences correct for dissimilar, 10% for similar) and a small but significant effect for semantic similarity (71% versus 65%). I went on to demonstrate that this pattern reversed when long-term memory (LTM) was required by using ten-word lists and several learning trials; semantic similarity then proved critical (Baddeley 1966b). I concluded that there were two storage systems, a short-term phonological and a long-term semantically based system. My telephony project was passed on to a newly arrived colleague and I was left free to explore this line of basic research.

I saw my work as fitting into a pattern of evidence for separate STM and LTM stores. Other evidence came from amnesic patients who had preserved STM and impaired LTM, while other patients showed the reverse pattern (Shallice &Warrington 1970). A third source of evidence came from two-component memory tasks, which comprised a durable LTM component together with a temporary component. A typical example of this was the recency effect in free recall (Glanzer 1972); the last few words of a list are well recalled on immediate test but not after a brief filled delay, unlike earlier items.

[1] I subsequently abandoned the term "acoustic similarity" because it suggested an input modality-based system, which is not the case; I mistakenly assumed that phonological was a more neutral term. It was not intended as a statement of the linguistic basis of the memory system, which remains an open question.

我进行了实验，对比了五个音韵相近的词语（如 man, mat, can, map, cat）、五个音韵不相近的词语（如 pit, day, cow, pen, sup）以及五个语义相近（如 huge, big, wide, large, tall）和五个语义不相近（如 wet, soft, old, late, good）的序列的回忆效果。我发现（Baddeley 1966a），音韵相似性对回忆有巨大影响（音韵不相似序列正确率为 80%，音韵相似序列为 10%），而语义相似性虽影响较小但仍显著（71% 对比 65%）。进一步的研究显示，当转向需要长期记忆（LTM）的任务，如通过使用十个词的列表和多次学习试验时，情况则反转，这时语义相似性成为决定性因素（Baddeley 1966b）。由此，我得出结论，我们的记忆系统由两部分构成：一个短期的音韵存储系统和一个长期的基于语义的存储系统。我的电话线质量评估项目随后转交给了一位新加入的同事，这让我有机会自由地继续探索这一基础研究领域。

我的研究被视为支持短期记忆（STM）和长期记忆（LTM）为分离存储的证据之一。其他支持证据包括对于健忘症患者的观察，他们的 STM 保留完好而 LTM 受损，反之亦然（Shallice & Warrington 1970）。第三方面的证据则来源于包含持久 LTM 组件和临时组件的双组分记忆任务。其中一个典型例子是自由回忆测试中的近因效应（Glanzer 1972）：列表中的最后几个词在立即测试中回忆良好，但经过短暂的间隔后就不再如此，这与列表中早期的条目不同。

[1] 由于「声学相似性」这一术语暗示了一个基于输入模态的系统，而实际情况并非如此，我后来放弃使用它。我错误地以为「音韵」是一个更中立的术语。这个选择并不旨在对记忆系统的语言学基础做出断言，这个问题仍然悬而未决。

At this point, my simple assumption of two stores, with STM phonologically based and LTM semantically based, led to some clear predictions. Amnesic patients should have semantic coding problems, and recency should be acoustically based. Studies based on amnesic patients suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome did suggest a semantic encoding deficit (Cermak et al. 1974), but our own work showed no evidence of such a deficit (Baddeley & Warrington 1970), and later work (Cermak & Reale 1978) attributed their previously observed deficit to additional executive problems, often found in Korsakoff's syndrome.

In the case of two-component tasks, it became clear that recency did not depend on verbal STM (Baddeley & Hitch 1977) and that the use of semantic or phonological coding was strategy dependent. Phonological coding of verbal material is rapid, attentionally undemanding, and very effective for storing serial order. Semantic coding can be rapid for meaningful sequences such as sentences, but it is much harder to use for storing the order of unrelated words (Baddeley & Levy 1971). We also showed that word sequences can simultaneously be encoded both phonologically and semantically (Baddeley & Ecob 1970) and that standard tasks such as immediate serial recall can reflect both long-term and short-term components, each of which may be influenced by either phonological or semantic factors. In short, STM, retention of material over a brief period, may be based on either phonological or semantic coding. The former is easy to set up but readily forgotten; the latter may take longer to set up but tends to be more durable. Both can operate over brief delays, and the fact that we can learn new words indicates that long-term phonological learning also occurs.

It is worth emphasizing the need to distinguish between STM as a label for a paradigm in which small amounts of information are stored over brief delays and STM as a theoretical storage system. This point was made by Waugh & Norman (1965) and by Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968), but it has often been neglected in subsequent years. Material tested after a brief delay (i.e., an STM task) is likely to reflect both LTM and some form of temporary storage.

在这一点上，我对两种存储系统（STM 以音韵为基础，LTM 以语义为基础）的简单假定引出了一些明确的预测。这意味着，健忘症患者将面临语义编码的难题，而近因效应则应该是基于声音的。对患有科萨科夫综合症的健忘症患者进行的研究似乎支持了存在语义编码的不足（Cermak 等人，1974 年），但我们自己的研究未发现此类不足（Baddeley & Warrington 1970），后续研究（Cermak & Reale 1978）则将这一发现的不足归咎于科萨科夫综合症常见的额外执行功能问题。

在涉及两个组件的任务中，显而易见的是，近因效应并不依赖于口头的 STM（Baddeley & Hitch 1977），且采用语义或音韵编码的选择依赖于使用的策略。对于言语材料，音韵编码既快速又不需要过多注意力，非常适合存储序列顺序。而对于有意义的序列如句子，语义编码虽快，但用于存储不相关单词顺序则较为困难（Baddeley & Levy 1971）。我们还发现，单词序列可以同时进行音韵和语义编码（Baddeley & Ecob 1970），并且像即时序列回忆这样的标准任务可以反映长短期组件，这些组件可能受到音韵或语义因素的影响。简言之，短期保持的材料可能基于音韵或语义编码。前者容易设置但容易忘记；后者设置可能较慢但更为持久。这两种编码都能在短时间延迟中工作，我们能够学习新单词的事实说明长期的音韵学习也是发生的。

需要强调的是，区分 STM 作为存储少量信息的短暂延迟的范式，以及 STM 作为理论上的存储系统的重要性。这一观点由 Waugh & Norman（1965）和 Atkinson & Shiffrin（1968）提出，但在后来经常被忽略。在短暂延迟后进行测试的材料（即 STM 任务）很可能同时反映了 LTM 和某种形式的临时存储。

#### Evolution of a Multicomponent Theory

After nine years at the APU, I moved to Sussex into a new department of experimental psychology, where, in 1972, I was joined by Graham Hitch as a post-doctoral fellow on my first research grant. After a first degree in physics, he had done a psychology MSc in Sussex and a PhD with Broadbent at the APU. We had proposed (perhaps unwisely) to investigate the link between STM and LTM, beginning our grant just when the previously popular field of STM was downsizing itself following criticism of the dominant Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968) model for three reasons. First, the model assumed that merely holding information in STM would guarantee transfer to LTM, whereas Craik & Lockhart (1972) showed that the nature of processing is crucial, with deeper, more elaborate processing leading to better learning. Second, its assumption that the short-term store was essential for access to LTM proved to be inconsistent with neuropsychological evidence. Patients with a digit span of only two items and an absence of recency in free recall should, according to Atkinson and Shiffrin, have a defective short-term store that should lead to impaired LTM. This was not the case. Third, given that Atkinson and Shiffrin assumed their short-term store to be a working memory, playing an important general role in cognition, such patients should have major intellectual deficits. They did not. One patient, for instance, was an efficient secretary, and another ran a shop and a family. Interest in the field began to move from STM to LTM, to semantic memory and levels of processing.

多组份理论发展史

在 APU（应用心理单位）工作了九年之后，1972 年，我转到了苏塞克斯大学的一个全新实验心理学系。不久，格雷厄姆·希奇博士作为我的第一笔研究经费支持的博士后研究员加入了我。希奇博士拥有物理学本科背景，随后在苏塞克斯大学攻读心理学硕士，并在 APU 跟随布罗德本特教授完成了他的博士学位研究。我们有些冒险地提出要探索短时记忆（STM）与长时记忆（LTM）之间的联系，这个项目的开始正值 STM 研究领域因受到对当时主流的 Atkinson & Shiffrin（1968 年）模型的三方面批评而开始缩减其研究规模。首先，该模型认为只要在 STM 中保持信息，就能自动转移至 LTM，但克莱克和洛克哈特在 1972 年的研究表明，信息处理的深度和细致程度对学习成效至关重要。其次，该模型将短期记忆库视为访问 LTM 的必要条件，这与神经心理学的发现不符。例如，某些患者虽然数字记忆跨度仅为两项，并且在自由回忆测试中没有显示出近因效应，但他们的长期记忆并未受损，这与 Atkinson 和 Shiffrin 的预期相悖。第三，按照 Atkinson 和 Shiffrin 的看法，既然他们认为短期记忆库是一种在认知过程中发挥广泛作用的工作记忆，那么受损的短期记忆库应会导致严重的智力缺陷，但实际情况并非如此，例如，一位患者能高效地担任秘书工作，另一位则同时经营着商店和家庭。随着时间的推移，研究人员的兴趣从 STM 转移到了 LTM，进而到语义记忆和处理级别的研究。

Graham Hitch and I did not have access to these rare but theoretically important STM-deficit patients and instead decided that we would try to manufacture our own "patients" using student volunteers. We did so, not by removing the relevant part of their brain, but by functionally disabling it by requiring participants to do a concurrent task that was likely to occupy the limited-capacity short-term storage system to varying degrees. The concurrent task we chose was serial verbal recall of sequences of spoken digits. As sequence length increased, the digits should occupy more and more of available capacity, with the result that performance on any task relying on WM should be progressively impaired. In one study, participants performed a visually presented grammatical reasoning task while hearing and attempting to recall digit sequences of varying length. Response time increased linearly with concurrent digit load. However, the disruption was far from catastrophic: around 50% for the heaviest load, and perhaps more strikingly, the error rate remained constant at around 5%. Our results therefore suggested a clear involvement of whatever system underpins digit span, but not a crucial one. Performance slows systematically but does not break down. We found broadly similar results in studies investigating both verbal LTM and language comprehension, and on the basis of these, abandoned the assumption that WM comprised a single unitary store, proposing instead the three-component system shown in Figure 1 (Baddeley & Hitch 1974).

Figure 1 The original Baddeley & Hitch (1974) working memory model.

We aimed to keep our proposed system as simple as possible, but at the same time, potentially capable of being applied across a wide range of cognitive activities. We decided to split attentional control from temporary storage, which earlier research suggested might rely on separate verbal and visuo-spatial short-term systems, all of which were limited in capacity. We labeled the central controller as a "central executive" (CE), initially referring to the verbal system as the "articulatory loop," after the subvocal rehearsal assumed to be necessary to maintain information, and later adopting the term "phonological loop" to emphasize storage rather than rehearsal. We termed the third component the "visuo-spatial sketchpad," leaving open the issue of whether it was basically visual, spatial, or both.

格雷厄姆·希奇和我未能接触到那些少见但对理论极其重要的短时记忆缺失患者，因此我们决定尝试自己「制造」患者，方法是利用学生志愿者。我们并没有通过手术移除他们大脑的某部分，而是通过让他们同时进行另一项任务来在功能上限制他们的大脑，这项任务很可能会占用有限的短期存储系统的不同程度的容量。我们选定的这项任务是要求他们序列回忆口头给出的数字。随着数字序列长度的增加，这些数字将占用更多的存储容量，导致依赖工作记忆的任何任务的性能逐渐下降。在一项实验中，参与者一边听并尝试回忆不同长度的数字序列，一边进行视觉呈现的语法推理任务。我们发现，随着同时进行的数字任务负载的增加，反应时间线性延长。但是，这种干扰远没有达到灾难性的程度：在最重的负载下，性能下降约 50%，更令人注意的是，错误率保持在大约 5% 的水平。因此，我们的研究结果清晰地显示了某个系统在维持数字记忆跨度方面的参与，但这种参与并非决定性的。虽然性能会系统地减慢，但并不会完全崩溃。在研究口头长时记忆和语言理解时，我们发现了类似的结果。基于这些发现，我们放弃了工作记忆包含单一统一存储的假设，转而提出了一个由三个部分组成的系统，即 Baddeley & Hitch（1974 年）的工作记忆模型。

图 1 Baddeley & Hitch（1974）工作记忆模型的原始图。

我们设想的系统尽可能简单，但同时又能够广泛适用于各种认知活动。我们选择将注意力控制与暂时性存储分离，这是基于早期研究的建议，即可能依赖于独立的口头和视觉-空间短期记忆系统，这些系统都有容量限制。我们把这个中心控制单元称为「中央执行器」，并最初将处理口头信息的系统称为「言语循环」，后来改称「语音循环」，以强调其存储而非重复的功能。我们将第三个组成部分命名为「视觉-空间草图本」，这留下了一个问题：它基本上是视觉的、空间的还是两者兼而有之。

We began by focusing on the phonological loop on the grounds that it seemed the most tractable system to investigate, given the very extensive earlier research on verbal STM. At this point, I unexpectedly received an invitation from Gordon Bower to contribute a chapter to an influential annual publication presenting recent advances in the area of learning and memory.We hesitated; our model was far from complete, should we perhaps wait? We went ahead anyhow (Baddeley & Hitch 1974), presenting a model that is still not complete nearly 40 years and many publications later.

Over the next decade we continued to explore the model and its potential for application beyond the cognitive laboratory. At this point I agreed to summarize our progress in a monograph (Baddeley 1986). This was approaching completion when I realized that I had said nothing about the CE, very much a case of Hamlet without the prince. My reluctance to tackle the executive stemmed from two sources: first, its probable complexity, and second, because of the crucial importance of its attentional capacity. Although there were a number of highly developed and sophisticated theories of attention, most were concerned with the role of attention in perception, whereas the principal role of the CE was the attentional control of action. The one directly relevant article I could find (Norman & Shallice 1986) appeared as a chapter because of the difficulty of persuading a journal to accept it (Shallice 2010, personal communication), alas, all too common with papers presenting new ideas.

在我们的研究早期，我们集中精力于语音循环这一部分，因为先前关于口头短时记忆的研究已经十分广泛，这使得语音循环成为最容易研究的系统。就在这时，我意外地收到了戈登·鲍尔的邀请，要求我为一个展示学习和记忆最新进展的重要年度出版物贡献一章。面对这个机会，我们犹豫了 —— 我们的模型还远未完善，我们是不是应该等待它更加成熟呢？但最终，我们还是决定继续（Baddeley & Hitch 1974），提交了一个即便在将近 40 年后经过众多研究仍不完整的模型。

在随后的十年里，我们不断深入探索这个模型以及它在认知实验室以外应用的可能性。在这个过程中，我答应用一部专著（Baddeley 1986）来总结我们的研究进展。就在专著接近完成时，我突然意识到我竟然没有提到中央执行器，这就好比《哈姆雷特》缺失了王子一般。我之所以对研究执行功能感到犹豫，一方面是因为其潜在的复杂性，另一方面是因为其在注意力管理中的关键作用。虽然已有许多关于注意力的高度发展和复杂的理论，但它们大多数聚焦于注意力在感知中的作用，而中央执行器的主要职责却是控制行动的注意力。我找到的唯一一篇直接相关的研究（Norman & Shallice 1986）因为难以被学术期刊接受而以章节形式发表（Shallice 2010，个人交流），这也反映了一个遗憾的现实：提出新观点的论文往往难以获得认可。

Norman and Shallice proposed that action is controlled in two rather separate ways. One is based on well-learned habits or schemata, demanding little in the way of attentional control. An example of this might be the activity of driving a well-learned route to your office. This source of control can be overridden by a second process, the supervisory attentional system (SAS), which responds to situations that are not capable of being handled by habit-based processes, for example, coping with the closure of a road on your normal route.

With some relief, I incorporated the Norman and Shallice model into my own concept of a CE, producing a book (Baddeley 1986) that attempted to pull together developments in WM that had occurred in the previous decade and then apply them to data from the literature in three areas: fluent reading, the development of WM in children, and the effects of aging. Although I tended to refer to our proposals as a model, using the criteria proposed earlier, it might better be regarded as a simple theory, in the sense of Toulmin's idea of theories as maps, linking together existing knowledge and encouraging further investigation. If so, it was a map with many blank areas that I hoped would be filled by myself and others, leading in due course to more detailed modeling.

诺曼和沙利斯提出了一个观点，即我们的行为控制主要依靠两种相互独立的机制。一种机制是基于我们熟练掌握的习惯或程序，这种控制几乎不需要我们投入多少注意力。比如，开车沿着熟悉的路线去办公室就是一个例子。然而，当遇到习惯无法解决的情况时，比如平时的道路被封闭，就需要第二种机制介入，即监督性注意系统（SAS）。这是一种在我们的习惯性处理方式失效时介入的过程，它负责应对那些需要我们改变常规做法的情况。

我将诺曼和沙利斯的这一理论概念融合进了我关于中央执行器的想法中，并在此基础上撰写了一本书（Baddeley 1986），努力将过去十年在工作记忆领域的研究成果进行汇总，并尝试将这些理论应用于三个特定领域的现实情况：流畅的阅读、儿童工作记忆的发展，以及衰老对记忆的影响。虽然我更倾向于将我们的工作称之为「模型」，但按照图尔明对理论的定义 —— 即理论像是一张地图，不仅串联起已有的知识，还激励着进一步的探索 —— 我的工作可能更接近于一种简单的理论。如果真是这样，我的这张「地图」还有许多空白处待填补。我希望，通过我自己和其他研究者的共同努力，这些空白区域将逐渐得到补充，最终促使我们能够形成更加详尽的理论模型。

What then are the essentials of the broad theory? The basis is the assumption that it is useful to postulate a hypothetical limitedcapacity system that provides the temporary storage and manipulation of information that is necessary for performing a wide range of cognitive activities. A second assumption is that this system is not unitary but can be split into an executive component and at least two temporary storage systems, one concerning speech and sound while the other is visuo-spatial. These three components could be regarded as modules in the sense that they comprise processes and storage systems that are tightly interlinked within the module and more loosely linked across modules, with somewhat more remote connections to other systems such as perception and LTM. I regard the very rigid definition of modularity by Fodor (1983) as unhelpful and neuropsychologically implausible. A consequence of my rejection of Fodorian simplicity is the assumption that each of these systems can be fractionated into subsystems and that these will be linked to perceptual and LTM processes in ways that require further investigation.

My overall view of WM therefore comprised, and still comprises, a relatively loose theoretical framework rather than a precise model that allows specific predictions. The success of such a framework should be based, as suggested by Lakatos (1976), not only on its capacity to explain existing data but also on its productivity in generating good, tractable questions linked to empirical methods that can be widely applied. The proposed components of WM are discussed in turn, beginning with the phonological loop.

那么，这个广泛的理论核心包含哪些要素呢？首先，我们基于这样一个前提：提出一个假想的有限容量系统是非常有用的，该系统负责提供执行各种认知活动所必需的信息临时存储和处理能力。第二个前提是，这个系统并不是单一整体，而是可以分为一个执行部分和至少两个专门的临时存储系统，分别处理语言及声音和视觉 - 空间信息。这三个部分可以视为独立的模块，因为它们内部的处理过程和存储系统之间有着紧密的联系，而模块之间的联系则相对宽松，与感知和长期记忆等其他系统的联系则更加间接。我认为 Fodor（1983）对模块化的极为严格定义并不实用，且在神经心理学上看来也不太可能成立。反对 Fodor 式的简化观点，我更倾向于认为，每个系统都可以进一步细分为子系统，这些子系统与感知和长期记忆的过程之间的关系，还需要我们进一步探究。

因此，我的工作记忆总览不是一个能够提供具体预测的精确模型，而是一个相对宽泛的理论框架。正如拉卡托斯（Lakatos，1976）所指出的，一个理论框架的成功，不仅在于它解释已有数据的能力，还在于它能否产生一系列好的、可行的问题，这些问题能够通过广泛应用的实证方法来探索。接下来，我将逐一介绍工作记忆中提出的各个组件，首先从语音循环开始讲起。

### 02

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PHONOLOGICAL LOOP

We saw the phonological loop as a relatively modular system comprising a brief store together with a means of maintaining information by vocal or subvocal rehearsal. In the 1960s, a number of studies attempted to decide whether forgetting in the STM system was based on trace decay or interference (see Baddeley 1976). None of these studies proved to be conclusive, a state of affairs that remains true, in my own opinion. We opted to assume a process of trace decay, partly on the basis of our results and partly because it avoided the need to become involved in the many controversies surrounding traditional approaches to interference theory at the time (see Baddeley 1976, chapter 5), although we did assume a limited-capacity store, which in turn implies some unspecified form of interference, either by displacement or by overwriting. We used existing results, together with our own subsequent studies, to create a simple model that is based on the method of converging operations. This involves combining evidence from a range of different phenomena, each consistent with the model, but each individually explicable in other ways. If none of the competing interpretations are able to explain the whole pattern, whereas the phonological loop model can, then this provides valuable support. This approach has the advantage of potentially producing a robust model, but it has the disadvantage of being required to confront a range of different possible alternative explanations for each individual phenomenon.

我们认为语音循环是一个比较独立的系统，它包括了一个短期存储和一种通过声音或心里默念来维持信息的方法。在 20 世纪 60 年代，众多研究尝试确定短期记忆系统的遗忘是由记忆痕迹的衰减（痕迹衰减）还是外界信息的干扰（干扰）造成的（参见 Baddeley 1976 年的研究）。这些研究都未能给出决定性的答案，这一点在我看来至今仍然成立。基于我们的研究结果，并考虑到避免卷入当时关于干扰理论传统方法的众多争议（详见 Baddeley 1976 年的研究，第 5 章），我们选择了痕迹衰减的假设。虽然我们确实设想了一个有限容量的存储系统，这暗示了某种未具体说明的干扰存在，可能是通过替换或覆盖的方式。我们结合现有研究和我们后续的研究成果，构建了一个基于收敛操作方法的简单模型。这个方法通过综合不同现象的证据，其中每个现象本身都可以用其他方式解释，但如果仅有的解释是语音循环模型，那么它就为我们提供了有力的支持。这种方法有构建一个强大模型的潜力，但它也面临一个挑战，即需要解释每个独立现象可能存在的各种不同的解释。

#### The Phonological Similarity Effect

As described above, this is regarded as an indication that phonological storage is involved. Its effect is principally on the storage of order information. Indeed, item information may be helped by similarity since it places constraints on possible responses. For this reason, studies that specifically attempt to investigate the loop tend to minimize the need to retain item information by repeatedly using the same limited set, for example, consonants. Studies using open sets, for instance, different words for each sequence, are more likely to reflect loss of item information and to show semantic and other LTM-based effects.

语音相似效应

正如之前所述，这被看作是涉及语音存储的一个证据。它主要影响的是记忆顺序的存储。实际上，由于相似性对可能的回答施加了限制，所以单词信息可能因相似性而受益。因此，专门研究这一循环机制的研究，往往通过反复使用同一有限组单词（如辅音）来减少保留单词信息的需求。那些使用不同单词组成的开放式序列的研究，更可能揭示单词信息的遗失，并展现出语义上的以及其他基于长期记忆的效应。

#### The Word Length Effect

We assumed that vocal or subvocal rehearsal was likely to occur in real time, with longer words taking longer and hence allowing more time for trace decay, thus leading to poorer performance. We studied the immediate recall of sequences of five words ranging in length from one syllable (e.g., pen day hot cow tub) to five syllables (e.g., university, tuberculosis, opportunity, hippopotamus, refrigerator) and found that performance declined systematically with word length. As expected, when participants were required to read out words of different lengths as rapidly as possible, there was a close correspondence between word length and articulation time. The simple way of expressing our results was to note that people are able to remember as many words as they can articulate in two seconds (Baddeley et al. 1975b).

We interpreted our data by assuming that longer words take longer to rehearse, resulting in more trace decay and poorer recall. Such decay is also likely to continue during the slower spoken recall of longer words. We presented evidence for time-based decay, which has since faced challenge and counter-challenge (see Baddeley 2007, pp. 43–49). Fortunately, however, the general hypothesis of a phonological loop will function equally well with either a decay or interference interpretation of short-term forgetting, illustrating the value of combining a broad theoretical map while leaving more detailed modeling to be decided by further experimentation.

单词长度效应

我们认为，无论是出声还是心中默念的复述很可能是实时发生的，较长的单词需要更多复述时间，因此有更多时间发生记忆痕迹的衰减，进而导致记忆表现的下降。我们研究了立刻回忆从单音节（例如，「笔日热牛浴」）到五音节（例如，「大学」，「结核病」，「机会」，「河马」，「冰箱」）长度的五个单词序列，发现记忆表现随单词长度增加而系统性降低。如预期，当参与者被要求尽快朗读不同长度的单词时，单词长度与说话时间之间存在紧密的联系。我们研究结果的一个简单表述是，人们能记住的单词数量相当于他们两秒内能朗读的单词数量（Baddeley 等人，1975b）。

我们通过假定较长的单词需要更多的复述时间，从而导致更多记忆痕迹的衰减和更差的回忆来解释我们的数据。这种衰减在较慢地口头回忆较长单词时也可能继续发生。我们提出了时间衰减的证据，但这一假设后来遭到了挑战和反挑战（参见 Baddeley 2007 年，第 43-49 页）。幸运的是，无论是采取衰减还是干扰来解释短期记忆的遗忘，语音循环的总体假设都同样有效，这展示了在保持宽泛的理论框架的同时，将更细节的模型留给后续实验来确定的价值。

#### Articulatory Suppression

If the word length effect is dependent on subvocalization, then preventing it should eliminate the effect. This is indeed the case (Baddeley et al. 1975b). When participants are required to continuously utter a single word such as "the," performance drops and is equivalent for long and short words. Suppression also removes the phonological similarity effect for visually presented materials but not when presentation is auditory (Baddeley et al. 1984). We interpret this as suggesting that spoken material gains obligatory access to the phonological store, whereas written material needs to be subvocalized if it is to register.

The claim that auditory presentation allows a phonological trace to be laid down despite suppression has recently been challenged. Jones et al. (2006) have suggested that the effect is limited to the recency component of immediate serial recall, suggesting that it is better regarded as a perceptual effect. However, although this may be true for long lists, shorter lists show an effect that operates throughout the serial position curve (Baddeley & Larsen 2007).

口述干扰技术

如果单词长度效应是基于心中默念的，那么阻断这一过程就应该能消除这种效应。研究证实了这一点（Baddeley 等人，1975b）。当要求参与者不断地重复一个单词，比如「the」，他们的记忆表现会下降，而且长短单词的记忆效果没有差别。这种干扰方式同样可以消除视觉呈现材料的语音相似效应，但如果材料是通过听觉呈现的，则不受影响（Baddeley 等人，1984）。我们认为，这表明通过口述呈现的信息能够直接进入语音存储系统，而书写材料则需要在心中被默读一遍才能被记住。

尽管存在干扰，通过听觉呈现的信息依旧能在语音存储中留下痕迹的观点最近遭到了质疑。Jones 等人（2006）认为，这种效应仅限于即时顺序回忆的最近几项，这表明它更应被看作是一种感知效应。然而，尽管这对于长序列可能成立，对于短序列而言，研究显示出的效应却是贯穿整个序列位置曲线的（Baddeley & Larsen 2007）。这说明，即使在口述干扰的情况下，我们也能通过特定的实验设计揭示出不同记忆效应的存在和特性。

#### Irrelevant Sound Effects

Colle & Welsh (1976) required their participants to recall sequences of visually presented digits presented either in silence or accompanied by white noise or by speech in an unfamiliar language that they were told to ignore. Only the spoken material disrupted performance on the visually presented digits, an effect that was independent of the loudness of the irrelevant sound sources. Pierre Salame, a French visitor to Cambridge, and I followed up and extended Colle's work, demonstrating that visual STM was disrupted to the same extent by irrelevant words and nonsense syllables; indeed, irrelevant digits had no more effect on digit recall than did nondigit words containing the same phonemes (e.g., one two replaced by tun woo), suggesting that interference was operating at a prelexical level. We did, however, find slightly less disruption of our monosyllabic digits from bisyllabic words than from monosyllabic words, concluding rather too hastily that this suggested that interference was dependent on phonological similarity (Salame & Baddeley 1986). Like Colle and Welsh, we suggested an interpretation in terms of some form of mnemonic masking. This proved to be something of an embarrassment when it was clearly demonstrated that irrelevant items that were phonemically similar to the remembered sequence were no more disruptive than dissimilar items ( Jones & Macken 1995, Larsen et al. 2000). Unfortunately, our initial hypothesis came to be regarded as central toWM, despite our subsequent withdrawal, a salutary lesson in premature theorizing.

Meanwhile Dylan Jones and colleagues in Wales were developing a very extended program of research on irrelevant sound. They showed that STM was disrupted not only by irrelevant speech, but also by a range of other sounds, including, for example, fluctuating tones ( Jones & Macken 1993). In order to account for their results they proposed the "changing state" hypothesis, whereby the crucial feature was that the irrelevant sound needed to fluctuate. Jones (1993) coupled this with the object-orientated episodic record (OOE-R) hypothesis, which assumes that both digits and irrelevant sounds are represented as potentially competing paths on a multidimensional surface. The OOE-R hypothesis is not spelled out in detail but would appear to assume that serial order is based on chaining, whereby each item acts as a stimulus for the response that follows, which in turn acts as a further stimulus.

1976 年，Colle 和 Welsh 进行了一项研究，要求参与者回忆在静默状态下或伴随白噪声或一个他们被告诫要忽略的陌生语言背景下视觉呈现的数字序列。结果显示，只有口头材料显著干扰了对视觉呈现数字的回忆，而这种干扰效果与背景声音的响度无关。Pierre Salame（一位来访的法国学者）和我继续深入探索了 Colle 的研究，发现视觉短时记忆被不相关的单词和无意义音节同样地干扰。事实上，不相关的数字对数字记忆的干扰并不超过包含相同音素的非数字单词（例如，「one two」被替换为「tun woo」），这暗示干扰发生在词汇形成前的阶段。我们确实发现，来自双音节词的干扰略少于单音节词，这让我们过早地推断干扰依赖于语音相似性（Salame & Baddeley 1986）。正如 Colle 和 Welsh 所建议的，我们尝试用某种记忆遮蔽的形式来解释这一现象，但当后续研究清楚地证明与记忆序列音位相似的不相关项目并不比不相似项目造成更大干扰时（Jones & Macken 1995, Larsen et al. 2000），这一解释变得尴尬。遗憾的是，尽管我们后来撤回了我们的初步假设，它还是被看作是工作记忆理论的核心，这给我们上了一个过早理论化的教训。

与此同时，Dylan Jones 和他在威尔士的同事们对不相关声音进行了深入的研究。他们发现，短时记忆不仅会被不相关的言语干扰，还会被包括波动音调在内的其他声音干扰（Jones & Macken 1993）。为了解释他们的发现，他们提出了「变化状态」假设，强调不相关声音需要有波动性才能造成干扰。Jones（1993）将这一假设与面向对象的情节记录（OOE-R）假设结合起来，认为数字和不相关声音在多维空间上形成了潜在的竞争路径。OOE-R 假设虽然没有详细说明，但似乎认为序列的顺序是基于链式反应的，即每个项目都作为下一个反应的刺激，由此形成了进一步的链式作用。这些理论的探索不仅展示了记忆研究领域的复杂性，也强调了对于记忆过程深入理解的追求。

#### Retaining Serial Order

A typical memory span is around six or seven digits, not because the digits themselves are forgotten, but rather because their order is lost. Retaining serial order is a crucial demand for a wide range of activities, notably including language, in which sequences of sounds within words and words within sentences must be maintained, and skilled motor performance such as striking a ball with a bat or playing the piano. However, as Lashley (1951) points out, it is far from easy to explain how this is achieved. The most obvious hypothesis is through the previously described mechanism of chaining through sequential associations. However, this has some major potential problems; if one item is lost, then the chain is broken and subsequent recall should fail, and yet it is often the case that despite errors in the middle of a sequence, the latter part is reproduced correctly. Similarly, if an item is repeated within the chain (e.g., 753 596), then the chain should be disrupted, but this disruption, when it occurs, is typically far from dramatic.

A third phenomenon appears to be even more problematic. This again is an effect that was discovered when trying to solve a practical problem, that of trying to reduce the negative impact of phonological similarity on the recall of postal codes. It seemed plausible to me to assume that the principal effect of similarity would come from having two or more similar items bunched together, in which case it might prove possible to greatly minimize the effect by alternating similar and dissimilar items (e.g., dfvkpl ). The results were disappointing; the similar items appeared to be just as liable to be forgotten when sandwiched between dissimilar items as when they were adjacent, so we put the experiment to one side. It was only later, when I was attempting to pin down the nature of the phonological loop effect, that I realized that our result had clear implications for theories of serial order retrieval in general (Baddeley 1968) and were in particular inconsistent with hypotheses that depended upon chaining. The argument goes as follows: If one considers a sequence of six letters as a series of pairs, then we know that the principal source of interference comes from similarity at the stimulus level, which then gives rise to errors on the subsequent response (Osgood 1949). We would therefore expect errors to follow the similar items, whereas in fact the similar items themselves were the main source of error (Baddeley 1968). This result has continued to present a challenge to models of serial order.

记忆中的序列顺序问题

典型的记忆容量大约能够处理六到七个数字，限制不在于忘记这些数字本身，而是丢失了它们的排列顺序。无论是语言中单词内部的声音顺序和句子中单词的排列，还是击球和弹钢琴等熟练的运动技能，保持序列的顺序对许多活动都至关重要。然而，如 Lashley（1951）所述，解释这一现象的机制并不简单。一个显而易见的解释是，这是通过序列关联形成的链接机制来实现的。但是，这个假设存在明显的问题：如果序列中的一个环节丢失，整个记忆链就会断裂，理论上后续的记忆也应随之崩溃，然而实际上，即使序列中间出现错误，序列的后半部分仍能被正确回忆。

第三个现象更是让人头疼。这个问题在尝试解决语音相似性对邮政编码回忆负面影响的实际问题时被发现。我本以为，相似性带来的主要影响可能是由于几个相似项聚集在一起造成的，如果能通过交替排列相似和不相似项（例如，dfvkpl）来减小这种效应。但结果却令人失望；无论是夹在不相似项之间，还是与其他相似项相邻，这些相似项似乎都同样容易被遗忘，因此我们暂时搁置了这项实验。直到后来，当我试图深入理解语音循环效应的本质时，我才意识到我们的实验结果对于一般的序列顺序回溯理论有着重要的意义（Baddeley 1968），尤其是它与依赖链接机制的假设相矛盾。简而言之，如果我们将六个字母的序列视为一系列对，则我们知道，相似性在刺激层面引起的干扰是导致后续反应出错的主要原因（Osgood 1949）。因此，我们本应预期错误会在相似项之后出现，但实际上，相似项本身却成了错误的主要源头（Baddeley 1968）。这一发现对于序列顺序模型构成了持续的挑战。

The past decade has seen considerable activity in the attempt to produce clearly specified computational or mathematical models of serial order retention, with a number located within the phonological loop tradition. Very briefly, approaches fall into two categories. One class of models assumes that items are associated with a series of internal markers, which may be temporal oscillators as in Brown et al.'s (2000) OSCAR hypothesis, or other forms of ordinal marking, as in the case of the model and its subsequent refinement by Burgess & Hitch (1999, 2006). A second approach is typified by the primacy hypothesis of Page & Norris (1998), which assumes a limited capacity of excitation that is shared among the sequence of items. The first item is the most strongly activated, the second slightly less, and so forth. At recall, the strongest item is retrieved first and then inhibited to avoid further repetition before going on to the next strongest. Both of these approaches can handle the similarity sandwich effect, as they do not depend upon chaining. Furthermore, they require two stages, a store and a serial order link, offering an interpretation of the irrelevant sound effect in terms of adding noise to this additional stage (Page & Norris 2003), an explanation as to why similarity between irrelevant and remembered items is not important.

Modeling serial order continues to be a very lively field with considerable interaction between proponents of the different models, which are now starting to become more ambitious. Burgess and Hitch are now attempting to model the link between the phonological loop and long-term phonological learning (Burgess & Hitch 2006, Hitch et al. 2009), while a further challenge being addressed lies in the interpretation of chunking, the effect that makes sentences so much more readily recalled than scrambled words (Baddeley et al. 2009). Can models of serial order in verbal STM be generalized to visual STM? The answer seems to be that they can (Hurlstone 2010). If so, do they reflect a single common system? I myself think it more likely that evolution has applied the same solution to a problem, maintaining serial order, that crops up in a range of different domains.

序列顺序保持的计算模型研究进展

在过去十年里，为了精确建立保持序列顺序的计算或数学模型，研究领域内展开了大量工作，其中许多研究基于语音循环的传统。简而言之，这些研究方法大致可以分为两类。一类模型认为，序列中的每个元素都与一系列内部标识符相关联，这些标识符可能是时间振荡器 —— 正如 Brown 等人（2000）在 OSCAR 模型中所提出的，或是其他形式的序数标记 —— 如 Burgess & Hitch（1999, 2006）所发展的模型及其进一步完善。另一种方法则是由 Page & Norris（1998）提出的首要性理论，它认为激活水平有限，并在序列的各个元素间共享。序列中的第一个元素获得最强的激活，第二个稍弱，依此类推。在回忆阶段，最强的元素首先被回忆出来，然后为避免重复而被抑制，接着转向下一个最强的元素。这两种方法都能够处理相似项被夹在中间的情况，因为它们不依赖于简单的链式连接。此外，这些模型需要两个阶段：存储和序列顺序链接，为不相关声音效应提供了解释，即在这一额外阶段增加噪音（Page & Norris 2003），说明了为何不相关和记忆项之间的相似性不重要。

序列顺序的建模仍是一个非常活跃的研究领域，不同模型的支持者之间存在着大量的交流，这些模型现在开始变得更加雄心勃勃。Burgess 和 Hitch 正尝试建模语音循环与长期语音学习之间的联系（Burgess & Hitch 2006, Hitch et al. 2009），同时，进一步挑战在于解释分块效应，即为何句子比杂乱无章的单词更易于回忆（Baddeley 等人 2009）。口头短时记忆中的序列顺序模型是否可以推广到视觉短时记忆？答案似乎是肯定的（Hurlstone 2010）。如果是这样，它们是否反映了一个共同的系统？我个人倾向于认为，进化对一系列不同领域中出现的保持序列顺序这一共同问题，采取了相同的解决策略。

#### The Phonological Loop and LTM

What function might the phonological loop (PL) serve, other than making telephoning easier (an unlikely target for Mother Nature)? The opportunity to investigate this question cropped up when an Italian colleague, Giuseppe Vallar, invited me to help him to investigate a patient, PV, with a very pure and specific deficit in phonological STM. Her intellect was preserved, but her auditory digit span was only two items. She had fluent language production and comprehension, except for long, highly artificial sentences in which ambiguity could only be resolved by retaining the initial part of a long sentence until the end, again not a great evolutionary gain. We then came up with the idea that her phonological loop might be necessary for new long-term phonological learning. We tested this by requiring her to learn Russian vocabulary (e.g., flower-svieti ), comparing this with her capacity for learning to pair unrelated Italian words, for example (castle-table). When compared to a group of matched controls, her capacity to learn native language pairs was normal, whereas she failed to learn a single Russian word after ten successive trials, a point at which all the normal participants had perfect performance (Baddeley et al. 1988). We had found a function for the phonological loop.

Although the work with PV had a major influence on my theoretical views, of much greater practical importance was my collaboration with Susan Gathercole, in which we explored the role of the phonological loop in vocabulary learning, both in children with specific language impairment and in normal children. A series of studies showed thatWM plays a significant role in the initial stages of vocabulary acquisition and is also linked to reading skills (see Baddeley et al. 1998 for a review). It formed the basis of an extensive and successful application of the M-WM theory to the identification and treatment of WM deficits in school-age children (Gathercole & Alloway 2008; Gathercole et al. 2004a,b).

除了简化打电话的过程（这似乎并不是大自然的主要设计目的）之外，语音回路（Phonological Loop, PL）可能还承担着哪些功能？这个问题的探索机会出现在一位意大利同事，Giuseppe Vallar，邀请我共同研究一个病例 PV 时，这位患者在语音短时记忆（Phonological Short-Term Memory, STM）方面有着非常明显且特定的缺损。她的智力未受影响，但她的听觉数字记忆跨度（Auditory Digit Span）仅限于两项内容。她的语言表达和理解能力流畅，唯一的例外是在长句子中，如果句中的歧义只能通过保留长句子开始部分直到末尾才能解决的情况下，她就会遇到困难，但这种情况对于进化来说并没有太大的价值。于是我们提出了一个假设，认为她的语音回路对于新的长期语音学习是必不可少的。我们通过要求她学习俄语词汇（例如，「flower」译为「svieti」），并将此与她学习匹配无关意大利词对（例如，「castle-table」）的能力进行了比较。与一组匹配的对照组相比，她学习母语词对的能力正常，但在十次连续尝试之后，她没有学会任何一个俄语单词，在所有正常参与者都已经完美掌握这些单词的阶段（Baddeley 等，1988）。我们因此为语音回路找到了一个功能。

尽管与 PV 的研究极大地影响了我的理论观点，但我与 Susan Gathercole 的合作研究对我来说具有更大的实际意义，我们在这项研究中探讨了语音回路在特定语言障碍儿童和正常儿童的词汇学习中的角色。一系列研究显示，工作记忆（Working Memory, WM）在词汇习得的初期阶段扮演着重要角色，并且与阅读技能息息相关（参见 Baddeley 等，1998 年的综述）。这成为了将多元工作记忆理论（Multi-component Working Memory, M-WM Theory）广泛而成功地应用于学龄儿童工作记忆缺陷的识别和治疗的基础（Gathercole & Alloway 2008; Gathercole 等，2004a,b）。

At a theoretical level, work with PV led to a major development. I had previously tended to treat WM and LTM as separate though interrelated systems. The fact that the loop specifically facilitates new phonological learning implies a direct link from the loop to LTM. Gathercole (1995) showed that existing language habits influence immediate nonword recall, making the nonwords that have a similar letter structure to English, such as contramponist, easier than less familiar sounding nonwords such as loddenapish (Gathercole 1995). This suggests that information flows from LTM to the loop, as well as the reverse. Furthermore, it seemed reasonable to assume that a similar state of affairs would occur for the visuo-spatial sketchpad, leading to a revision of the original model along the lines indicated in Figure 2. Here, a crucial distinction is made between WM, represented by a series of fluid systems that require only temporary activation, and LTM, representing more permanent crystallized skills and knowledge.

Figure 2 A modification of the original model to take account of the evidence of links between working memory and long-term memory (LTM).

在理论层次上，与 PV 的研究带来了重大进展。我以前更多地将工作记忆（Working Memory, WM）和长期记忆（Long-Term Memory, LTM）视为两个分开但又相互关联的系统。语音回路特别促进新的语音学习的这一现象，暗示了从语音回路到长期记忆之间存在直接的联系。Gathercole（1995）的研究表明，现有的语言习惯会影响到即时非词回忆，让那些字母结构与英语相似的非词，比如「contramponist」，比听起来不那么熟悉的非词，比如「loddenapish」更容易被回忆起来（Gathercole 1995）。这说明信息不仅从长期记忆流向语音回路，反向流动也是可能的。此外，我们有理由假设，在视觉 - 空间草图板（Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad）方面也会发生类似的情况，这导致我们对原始模型进行了修订，如图 2 所示。在这里，我们明确区分了只需要暂时激活的流动系统代表的工作记忆，以及代表更为永久性的结晶技巧和知识的长期记忆。

图 2：考虑到工作记忆与长期记忆之间联系的证据，对原始模型进行的修改。请注意，此描述没有提供图 2 的具体视觉内容，但主要强调了工作记忆与长期记忆之间的相互流动和联系。

#### The Phonological Loop: Master or Slave?

In formulating our model, we referred to the loop and sketchpad as slave systems, borrowing the term from control engineering. It is, however, becoming increasingly clear that the loop can also provide a means of action control. In my own case, this first became obvious during a series of studies of the CE, in this case concentrating on its capacity for task switching. We used a very simple task in which participants were given a column of single digits and required in one condition to add 1 and write down a total, and in another condition, to subtract 1, or in the switching condition, to alternate addition and subtraction. Switching leads to a substantial slowing, and we wanted to know why. We used dual task methods, disrupting the CE with an attentionally demanding verbal task and a task involving simple verbal repetition. To our surprise, switching was disrupted almost as much by articulatory suppression as by the much more demanding executive task. It became clear that people were using a simple subvocal code of "plus-minusplus," etc., to cue their responses. When the relevant plus and minus signs were provided on the response sheet, the suppression effect disappeared (Baddeley et al. 2001). Similar results have been obtained and further developed by Emerson & Miyake (2003).

The importance of self-instruction had of course already been beautifully demonstrated by the great Russian psychologist Alexander Luria, who showed that children gradually learn to control their actions using overt selfinstruction, a process that later becomes subvocal. He went on to demonstrate the value of self-instructions in neuropsychological rehabilitation (Luria 1959).

在我们模型的构建过程中，我们把语音回路和视觉 - 空间草图板描述为「从属系统」，这一术语是从控制工程领域借鉴而来的。然而，越来越多的证据表明，语音回路不仅仅是一个从属系统，它还能够提供行动控制的手段。在我的研究中，这一点首次在关于中央执行器（Central Executive, CE）的系列研究中显现出来，特别是在研究其任务切换能力时。我们设计了一个极其简单的任务：要求参与者处理一列数字，在某个条件下进行加 1 操作并记录结果，在另一个条件下进行减 1 操作，或在切换条件下，交替进行加法和减法。我们发现，任务切换显著降低了任务执行速度，我们希望探究其原因。我们采用了双任务实验方法，通过一个需要高度注意力的言语任务和一个简单的言语重复任务来干扰中央执行器。令我们惊讶的是，言语抑制（Articulatory Suppression）几乎和那些更具挑战性的执行任务一样，显著干扰了任务切换。人们显然是通过使用一个简单的次声编码「加 - 减 - 加」等来引导他们的反应。当我们在反应纸上明确提供了相应的加号和减号时，言语抑制的效应便消失了（Baddeley 等人，2001）。Emerson & Miyake（2003）的研究也获得了类似的结果，并对其进行了进一步的发展。

自我指令的重要性最初由俄罗斯的著名心理学家 Alexander Luria 展现出来。Luria 的研究显示，儿童逐渐学会通过明确的自我指令来控制自己的行为，这一过程最终会转变为次声的自我指令。他进一步证明了自我指令在神经心理康复中的重要价值（Luria，1959）。这些研究不仅深化了我们对语音回路在行动控制中作用的理解，也强调了心理学理论在实际应用中的巨大潜力。

#### The Phonological Loop: Critique

The loop is probably the best-developed and most widely investigated component of WM, possibly because of the availability of a few simple tools such as the phonological similarity, word length, and suppression effects. It is, however, only one very limited component of WM. When its use in digit span is prevented by combining visual presentation with articulatory suppression, the cost is something in the region of two digits (Larsen & Baddeley 2003). Its strength is that it can provide temporary sequential storage, using a process that is rapid, and requires minimal attention. It is a system that is extremely useful, widespread, and one that, as experimenters, we ignore at our peril. The analogy that comes to mind is that of the role of the thumb in our motor behavior: small, not essential, but very useful. There is, however, a danger of exaggerating its importance. It appears to be this that Nairne criticized under the label "the standard hypothesis" (Nairne 2002), by which he appears to refer to attempts to account for a range of time-specified STM effects purely in terms of the loop. This hypothesis seemed to be attributed to myself, although as discussed elsewhere (Baddeley 2007, pp. 35–38), Nairne's criticisms do not apply to WM more generally. I agree that what Nairne describes as the standard hypothesis is far from adequate as a theory of WM or even as a general account of STM.

I have discussed the phonological loop thus far as if it were limited to the storage of heard and spoken speech. It is important to note, however, that the same system, operating under broadly similar constraints, appears to underpin memory for both lip-read and signed material (see R¨onnberg et al. 2004 for a review). All of these are language related, which raises the question of whether the same system is used for nonlinguistic auditory information such as environmental sounds and music. Neither of these topics is well explored, although there is growing interest in comparing language and music and some indication of overlap (Williamson et al. 2010).

语音回路可能是工作记忆（Working Memory, WM）中最成熟和被广泛研究的部分，这可能得益于一些简单的工具，如语音相似性、词汇长度和发音抑制效应（Articulatory Suppression）。然而，它仅仅是 WM 中一个非常有限的组成部分。当通过结合视觉呈现和发音抑制来阻止其在数字记忆跨度（Digit Span）中的应用时，代价大约是丢失两个数字左右（Larsen & Baddeley 2003）。它的优势在于能够提供一种快速、几乎不需要注意力的临时顺序存储方式。它是一个极其有用和广泛应用的系统，作为研究者，我们忽略它是冒着风险的。它的作用可以类比为拇指在我们日常运动行为中的角色：虽小，不绝对必需，但却极为有用。然而，过分夸大其重要性也是有风险的。Nairne 在 2002 年批评的「标准假设」就是指这种倾向，他认为仅仅通过语音回路来解释一系列特定时间内的短时记忆（STM）效应是不足够的。尽管这一假设似乎被归咎于我，但如 Baddeley 在 2007 年的书中（第 35-38 页）讨论的，Nairne 的批评并不适用于更广泛的 WM 概念。我同意 Nairne 所描述的标准假设作为 WM 理论，甚至作为 STM 的一般账户都远远不充分。

到目前为止，我讨论的语音回路仿佛它仅限于存储听说的语言。然而，重要的是要注意，这一系统在广泛相似的约束下运作，似乎同样支持了对唇读和手语材料的记忆（见 Rönnberg 等人 2004 年的综述）。所有这些都与语言相关，但这引发了一个问题：这一系统是否也适用于非语言性听觉信息，如环境声音和音乐。尽管这两个领域都尚未被充分探索，但比较语言与音乐以及它们之间的一些潜在重叠正引起越来越多的关注（Williamson 等人 2010）。

VISUO-SPATIAL SKETCHPAD

Interest in visuo-spatial memory developed during the 1960s, when Posner & Konick (1966) showed that memory for a point on a line was well retained over a period ranging up to 30 seconds, but it was disrupted by an interpolated information-processing task, suggesting some form of active rehearsal. Dale (1973) obtained a similar result for remembering a point located in an open field. In contrast to these spatial memory tasks, Posner & Keele (1967) produced evidence suggesting a visual store lasting for only two seconds. However, their method was based on speed of processing letters, in which a visual letter code appeared to be superseded by a phonological code after two seconds. Although this could reflect the duration of the visual trace, it could equally well reflect a more slowly developing phonological code that then overrides the visual.

1960 年代，人们开始对视觉 - 空间记忆产生兴趣。当时，Posner & Konick (1966) 的研究表明，人们能够在长达 30 秒的时间内准确记住一条线上的某个点位置，但如果期间进行了其他信息处理任务，则这种记忆会受到干扰。这表明了某种形式的积极重复或练习在记忆保持中的作用。Dale (1973) 在一个开放空间中进行的研究得到了类似的结论，即记住一个特定位置的能力也会受到干扰。与此相反，Posner & Keele (1967) 的研究则表明，视觉记忆的持续时间可能只有短短两秒。他们的研究侧重于字母处理速度，发现视觉信息在被呈现后的两秒钟内似乎就被音位编码所取代。这可能指向视觉信息短暂的保持时间，也可能意味着音位编码发展得更慢，但最终会取代视觉信息。

#### Visual STM

A colleague, Bill Phillips, and I decided to test this using material that would not be readily nameable. We chose 5 × 5 matrices in which approximately half the cells would be filled at random on any given trial. We tested retention over intervals ranging from 0.3 to 9 seconds, by presenting either an identical stimulus or one in which a single cell was changed, with participants making a same/different judgment. We found a steady decline over time, regardless of whether we measured performance in terms of accuracy or reaction time (Phillips & Baddeley 1971). A range of studies by Kroll et al. (1970), using articulatory suppression to disrupt the use of a name code in letter judgments, came to a similar conclusion, that the Posner and Keele result was based on switching from a visual to a phonological code, perhaps because of easier maintenance by subvocal rehearsal. Meanwhile, Phillips went on to investigate the visual memory store using matrix stimuli, demonstrating that accuracy declines systematically with number of cells to be remembered (Phillips 1974), suggesting limited visual STM capacity. It was this work that influenced our initial concept of the visuo-spatial sketchpad.

视觉短期记忆

我与同事 Bill Phillips 共同进行了一项实验，我们选择了一些不易直接命名的材料进行测试。我们用了 5×5 的矩阵，随机填充约一半的单元格。我们的测试通过改变一个单元格或保持不变，并让参与者判断这两次是否相同，从而覆盖了 0.3 秒至 9 秒的不同时间间隔。结果显示，无论是从准确率还是反应时间来看，性能都随时间递减（Phillips & Baddeley 1971）。此外，Kroll 等人（1970）的研究通过在字母判断任务中使用语言抑制技术来阻断命名代码的使用，也得出了相似的结论，即从视觉编码转换到音位编码，可能是因为默读重复更容易进行记忆维持。Phillips 后来又通过使用矩阵刺激进一步探索了视觉记忆存储，发现记忆准确性随着要记忆的单元格数增加而下降（Phillips 1974），指出了视觉短期记忆容量的限制。这些研究工作启发了我们对视觉 - 空间记忆板概念的初步构想。

#### Spatial STM

The most frequently used clinical test of visuospatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping test (Milner 1971), which is spatially based and involves sequential presentation and recall. The participant views an array of nine blocks scattered across a test board. The tester taps a sequence of blocks, and the participant attempts to imitate this. The number of blocks tapped is increased until performance breaks down, with Corsi span typically being around five, about two less than digit span. Della Sala et al. (1999), using a modified version of the Phillips matrix task, showed that visual pattern span is dissociable from spatial Corsi span, with some patients being impaired on one while the other is preserved, and vice versa. Furthermore, pattern span can be disrupted by concurrent visual processing, whereas Corsi span is more susceptible to spatial disruption (Della Sala et al. 1999). I return to the visual-spatial distinction at a later point.

空间短期记忆

用于测试视觉空间记忆最常见的临床测试是 Corsi 块敲击测试（Milner 1971），它要求参与者按顺序回忆一系列在测试板上散布的九个块被敲击的顺序。测试者敲击一串块，参与者则尝试模仿。当参与者无法准确回忆时，即认为测试结束。通常，Corsi 测试的正常跨度大约是五，比数字记忆跨度少两个左右。Della Sala 等人（1999）对此进行了深入研究，他们发现视觉模式记忆与空间 Corsi 记忆是可以区分的，有些患者在一项任务上表现不佳，而另一项则保持正常，反之亦然。他们还发现，模式记忆容易受到视觉处理的干扰，而 Corsi 记忆则更易受到空间干扰（Della Sala 等人 1999）。关于视觉与空间记忆的区分，我将在后面进一步讨论。

#### Visuo-Spatial WM

During the 1970s, research moved from visual STM to its role in visual imagery. Our own studies used a technique developed by Brooks (1968), in which participants are required to remember and repeat back a sequence of spoken sentences. In half of the cases the sentences can be encoded as a path through a visually presented matrix. The other half of the instructions were not readily encodable spatially. We found that recall of the visuo-spatially codable sentences was differentially disrupted by pursuit tracking (Baddeley et al. 1975a). We interpreted this result in terms of the sketchpad, leading to the question of whether the underlying store was visual or spatial. This we tested using a task in which blindfolded participants tracked a sound source (spatial but not visual) or detected the brightening of their visual field (visual but not spatial), again while performing the Brooks task.We found that the tracking still disrupted the spatial but did not interfere with the verbal task, whereas the brightness judgment showed a slight tendency in the opposite direction, leading us to conclude that the system was spatial rather than visual (Baddeley & Lieberman 1980).

Although these results convinced me that the system was essentially spatial, Robert Logie, who was working with me at the time, disagreed and set out to show that I was wrong. He succeeded, demonstrating that some imagery tasks were visual rather than spatial. He used a visual imagery mnemonic whereby two unrelated items are associated by forming an image of them interacting; for example, cow and chair could be remembered as a cow sitting on a chair. Logie (1986) showed that this process can be disrupted by visual stimuli such as irrelevant line drawings or indeed by simple patches of color. There are now multiple demonstrations of the dissociation of visual and spatial WM. Klauer & Zhao (2004) critically review this literature before performing a very thorough series of investigations controlling for potential artifacts; their results support the distinction between visual and spatial STM, a distinction that is also supported by neuroimaging evidence (Smith & Jonides 1997).

Yet further fractionation of the sketchpad seems likely. Research by Smyth and colleagues has suggested a kinesthetic or movement-based system used in gesture and dance (Smyth & Pendleton 1990). Another possible channel of information into the sketchpad comes from haptic coding as used in grasping and holding objects, which in turn is likely to involve a tactile component. Touch itself depends on a number of different receptor cells capable of detecting pressure, vibration, heat, cold, and pain. We currently know very little about these aspects of STM, and my assumption that information from all of these sources converges on the sketchpad is far from clearly established. The nature of rehearsal in the sketchpad is also uncertain. Logie (1995, 2011) suggests a distinction between a "visual cache," a temporary visual store, and a spatial manipulation and rehearsal system, the "inner scribe," although the precise nature of visuo-spatial rehearsal remains unclear.

在 1970 年代，研究领域从视觉短期记忆转向了探讨其在视觉想象中的作用。我们采用了 Brooks（1968）开发的技术，参与者需要记住并回复一系列口头句子。其中一部分句子能够以视觉矩阵中的路径形式进行编码，而另一部分则不能。我们发现，能以视觉 - 空间方式编码的句子在执行追踪任务时，回忆效果受到影响（Baddeley 等人 1975a）。我们将这一发现归因于「视觉 - 空间草图本」，并进一步探讨了这一存储系统是视觉驱动还是空间驱动。通过让参与者在执行 Brooks 任务的同时，盲目地追踪声源或判断视场亮度变化，我们发现前者干扰了空间任务，但不影响语言任务；而后者则轻微地影响了语言任务。因此，我们认为该系统主要是空间导向的（Baddeley & Lieberman 1980）。

尽管这些结果让我相信系统本质上是空间导向的，我的同事 Robert Logie 却持不同意见，并且证明了我的看法是错误的。他展示了一些想象任务实际上是视觉导向而非空间导向的。通过一个视觉想象记忆技巧，将两个无关项通过互动的形象联系起来，例如，将「牛坐在椅子上」作为记忆，Logie（1986）发现这种过程可以被视觉刺激所干扰。目前已有多项研究证明了视觉与空间工作记忆的区分。Klauer & Zhao（2004）在执行了一系列严格控制潜在干扰因素的研究后，支持视觉与空间短期记忆之间的区别，这一发现也得到了神经影像学的支持（Smith & Jonides 1997）。

进一步细分「视觉 - 空间草图本」的可能性相当高。Smyth 及其团队的研究提出了一个基于运动的系统，用于手势和舞蹈（Smyth & Pendleton 1990）。另一个可能的信息输入方式是通过抓握和持有物体时使用的触觉编码，这可能涉及触觉成分。触觉本身依赖于能够检测压力、振动、温度和痛感的多种受体细胞。我们对这些短期记忆的方面了解甚少，目前还不清楚这些信息源是否都汇聚于「视觉 - 空间草图本」。此外，「视觉 - 空间草图本」中的复述机制也不明确。Logie（1995，2011）提出了「视觉缓存」（临时视觉存储）和「内部抄写员」（空间操纵和复述系统）之间的区别，但视觉 - 空间复述的确切机制仍然是个谜。

### 04

THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE

#### The Executive as Homunculus

The CE is the most complex component of WM. Within the original model it was assumed to be capable of attentional focus, storage, and decision making, virtually a homunculus, a little man in the head, capable of doing all the clever things that were outside the competence of the two subsystems. Although our model tended to be criticized for taking this approach, like Attneave (1960) I regard homunculi as potentially useful if used appropriately. It is important that they are not seen as providing an explanation, but rather as a marker of issues requiring explanation. Provided the various jobs performed by the homunculus are identified, they can be tackled one at a time, hopefully in due course allowing the homunculus to be pensioned off.

Much of our work has used concurrent tasks to disrupt the various components ofWM, with the assumption typically being that attentionally demanding tasks will place specific demands on the CE, in contrast to tasks that require simple maintenance. For example, counting backward in threes from a number such as 271 is assumed to load the executive, whereas simply repeating 271 would not. This and related tasks have proved to be a successful strategy for separating out contributions of the three initially proposed WM subcomponents (e.g., Baddeley et al. 2011).

工作记忆（Working Memory, WM）的中央执行器（Central Executive, CE）是其最为复杂的部分。在最初的模型设想中，中央执行器被认为具备注意力集中、存储和决策制定的能力，仿佛是大脑中的一个内在代理人（homunculus），这个「头脑中的小人」能够完成所有超出其他两个子系统能力范围的复杂任务。尽管我们的模型因采用这种假设而受到批评，我却像 Attneave (1960) 一样认为，如果适当使用，这种内在代理人观念是有其用处的。关键在于，不能将其视作一个解释本身，而是应当看作是标识出需要解释的问题的一个标记。只要明确了这个内在代理人所承担的各种任务，就可以逐一解决这些问题，希望最终无需再依赖这种设想。

我们的很多研究通过使用并行任务来中断工作记忆的不同组成部分，这些任务的选择基于一个典型假设：需要集中注意力的任务将对中央执行器提出特定的需求，这与那些仅需简单维持信息的任务形成对比。例如，假设从一个数如 271 开始向后每次减去三是一种对执行功能的负荷，而简单地重复说出 271 则不会造成这种负荷。这种方法及相关任务已被证明是一种成功的策略，用以区分工作记忆最初提出的三个子组件的不同功能（例如，Baddeley 等人，2011）。

#### Fractionating the Executive

In an attempt to specify the functions of the CE, I speculated as to what these might be; what would any adequate executive need to be able to do? I came up with four suggestions (Baddeley 1996). First it would need to be able to focus attention; evidence of this came from the impact of reducing attention on complex tasks such as chess (Robbins et al. 1996). A second desirable characteristic would be the capacity to divide attention between two important targets or stimulus streams. I had been studying this in collaboration with Italian colleagues for a number of years, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. We selected two tasks involving separate modalities: one verbal, involving recall of digit sequences, and the other requiring visuospatial tracking. We titrated the level of difficulty for each of these to a point at which our patients were performing at the same level as both young and elderly controls. We then required tracking and digit recall to operate simultaneously. There was a marked deficit in the performance of the patients when compared to either of the two control groups. Perhaps surprisingly, age did not disrupt this specific executive capacity, provided the level of difficulty is equated in the first place (Logie et al. 2004). In the absence of titration of level of difficulty, however, performance tends to decline with age on the tasks when performed singly, with the deficit even greater when the two tasks are performed at the same time (Riby et al. 2004).

The third executive capacity we investigated involved switching between tasks, for which we felt there might be a specific control system. As mentioned earlier, we chose to study a task involving alternating between simple addition and subtraction, using a demanding concurrent verbal executive task and articulatory suppression as its nondemanding equivalent. We found a large effect of articulatory suppression coupled with a rather small additional effect when an executive load accompanied suppression. The study of task switching has expanded very substantially in recent years (Monsell 2005), becoming theoretically rather complex, and in my view at least, arguing against a unitary executive capacity for task switching. I should point out that there are many other suggestions as to the basic set of executive capacities that are too numerous to discuss in this context (see, for example, Engle & Kane 2004, Miyake et al. 2000, Shallice 2002).

在尝试明确中央执行器（Central Executive, CE）的功能时，我推测了这些功能可能包括哪些要素；一个合格的执行者需要具备哪些能力呢？我提出了四点建议（Baddeley 1996）。首先，它应能集中注意力；来自于减少注意力对如国际象棋等复杂任务影响的证据支持了这一点（Robbins et al. 1996）。第二个理想特征是能够在两个重要目标或刺激流之间分配注意力。多年来，我与意大利的同事合作，专注于研究阿尔茨海默病，选择了两个涉及不同模式的任务：一个是关于数字序列的口头记忆，另一个是视觉空间追踪。我们调整了这些任务的难度，使我们的患者与年轻和老年的对照组表现相同。接着，我们要求患者同时进行追踪和数字回忆。与任一对照组相比，患者的表现有明显差距。出人意料的是，只要最初的难度水平设定得当，年龄并不影响这种特定的执行能力（Logie et al. 2004）。然而，如果没有事先调整难度水平，随着年龄的增长，在单独执行任务时表现往往会下降，而当同时执行两项任务时，性能损失更加明显（Riby et al. 2004）。

我们探索的第三种执行能力涉及任务间的切换，我们认为这可能涉及一个特定的控制系统。正如前文所述，我们选择了一个涉及交替进行简单加减法的任务，同时进行一个要求较高的并行口头执行任务和作为其轻松等价物的言语抑制。我们发现，言语抑制产生了显著的效应，而当执行负担伴随抑制时，仅观察到较小的额外效应。近年来，任务切换的研究已大幅扩展（Monsell 2005），变得理论上颇为复杂。至少在我看来，这反对了任务切换具有单一执行能力的观点。我应该指出，还有许多其他关于执行功能基本集的建议，它们太多以至于在此无法详细讨论（例如，可以参见 Engle & Kane 2004, Miyake et al. 2000, Shallice 2002）。

#### Interfacing with LTM

The fourth executive task that I assigned to our homunculus was the capacity to interface with LTM. In an attempt to constrain our WM model, we had made the assumption that the CE was a purely attentional system with no storage capacity (Baddeley & Logie 1999). However, this created a number of problems. One concerned the question of how subsystems using different codes could be integrated without some form of common storage. Participants do not simply use either one code or another, but rather combine them, with both visual and phonological codes being usable simultaneously (Logie et al. 2000). This capacity is particularly marked in the case of language processing, where a single phrase can show the influence of phonological coding at short delays and semantic coding at longer intervals (Baddeley & Ecob 1970). Memory span for unrelated words is around 5, increasing to 15 when the words make up a sentence. This enhanced span for sentencebased sequences seems to reflect an interaction between phonological and semantic systems rather than a simple additive effect (Baddeley et al. 1987), a conclusion that is consistent with later dual-task studies (Baddeley et al. 2009). But how might this interaction occur?

A further challenge to the concept of a purely attentional executive came from the very extensive work on individual differences in WM stemming from the initial demonstration by Daneman & Carpenter (1980) of a correlation between a measure they termed "WM span" and capacity for prose comprehension. Their measure required participants to read out a sequence of sentences and then recall the final word of each. This and similar tests that require the combination of temporary storage and processing have proved enormously successful in predicting performance on cognitive tasks ranging from comprehension to complex reasoning and from learning a programming language to resisting distraction (see Daneman & Merikle 1996 and Engle et al. 1999 for reviews). Such results were gratifying in demonstrating the practical significance of WM, but embarrassing for a model that had no potential for storage other than the limited capacities of the visuo-spatial and phonological subsystems. In response to these and related issues, I decided to add a fourth component, the episodic buffer (Baddeley 2000). Although I was reluctant to add further systems to the multicomponent theory, I felt that one in 25 years was perhaps acceptable.

我赋予我们的内在代理人（homunculus）的第四项执行任务是具备与长期记忆（Long-Term Memory, LTM）交互的能力。在我们尽力使工作记忆（Working Memory, WM）模型更加精确的过程中，我们曾假设中央执行器（Central Executive, CE）仅是一个专注的系统，没有存储功能（Baddeley & Logie 1999）。但这个假设引发了一系列问题。其中一个问题是，如果没有共享的存储形式，如何整合采用不同编码的子系统。参与者并不是简单地使用一个编码或另一个，而是将它们组合起来，同时利用视觉和语音编码（Logie et al. 2000）。这在语言处理中尤其明显，一个短语可以在短时间内显示语音编码的影响，在更长时间间隔显示语义编码的影响（Baddeley & Ecob 1970）。对无关单词的记忆跨度大约为 5，而当这些词构成一个句子时，记忆跨度可增加到 15。这种基于句子的序列的扩展跨度似乎反映了语音和语义系统之间的相互作用，而不仅仅是简单的叠加效应（Baddeley et al. 1987），这一结论与后来的双任务研究相符（Baddeley et al. 2009）。但这种相互作用是如何实现的呢？

对纯粹注意力执行概念的另一大挑战源于对工作记忆中个体差异的深入研究，这始于 Daneman & Carpenter (1980) 展示了他们所定义的「工作记忆跨度」与散文理解能力之间的相关性。他们的测量要求参与者阅读一系列句子然后回忆每句的最后一个词。这种测试以及其他需要临时存储与处理结合的测试，在预测从理解到复杂推理，从学习编程语言到抵抗干扰等认知任务的表现上取得了巨大成功（详见 Daneman & Merikle 1996 和 Engle et al. 1999 的综述）。这些成果在证明工作记忆的实际重要性方面是值得欣慰的，但对于一个模型而言，如果它除了视觉空间和语音子系统的有限容量之外没有其他存储潜能，这些发现则显得尴尬。为了应对这些问题，我决定增加第四个组件：情景缓冲区（Episodic Buffer, Baddeley 2000）。虽然我不愿在多组件理论中添加更多系统，但我觉得在 25 年里增加一个也许是可以接受的。

### 05

THE EPISODIC BUFFER

The characteristics of the new system are indicated by its name; it is episodic in that it is assumed to hold integrated episodes or chunks in a multidimensional code. In doing so, it acts as a buffer store, not only between the components of WM, but also linking WM to perception and LTM. It is able to do this because it can hold multidimensional representations, but like most buffer stores it has a limited capacity. On this point we agree with Cowan (2005) in assuming a capacity in the region of four chunks. I made the further assumption that retrieval from the buffer occurred through conscious awareness, providing a link with our earlier research on the vividness of visual and auditory imagery (Baddeley & Andrade 2000). This results in a theory of consciousness that resembles that proposed by Baars (1988), which assumes that consciousness serves as a mechanism for binding stimulus features into perceived objects. He uses the metaphor of a stage on which the products of preconscious processes, the actors, become available to conscious awareness, the audience.

Our new component could be regarded as a fractionation of our initial 1974 version of the CE into separate attentional and storage systems. It had a number of advantages in addition to providing a possible answer to the question of the interaction between LTM and WM. At a theoretical level it formed a bridge between our own bottom-up approach based on attempting to understand the peripheral systems first, and the more top-down approaches predominant in North America, which were more concerned with analyzing the executive and attentional aspects of WM (e.g., Cowan 2005, Engle et al. 1999). Perhaps for this reason, the concept appears to have been welcomed and is frequently cited. However, although that suggests that people find it useful, if it is to be theoretically productive, there is a need to use it to ask interesting and tractable questions, a challenge that has kept Graham Hitch, Richard Allen, and myself busy over recent years.

新系统的特点正如其名称所示；它被认为是情节性的，因为它假定能在一个多维编码中持有被整合的情节或信息块。它的作用是作为一个缓冲存储器，不仅连接工作记忆（WM）的各个组成部分，也将工作记忆与感知和长期记忆（LTM）联系起来。之所以能够做到这点，是因为它能够保存多维度的表示形式，但和大多数缓冲存储一样，它的容量是有限的。关于这一点，我们与 Cowan (2005) 的看法一致，认为其容量约为四个信息块。我进一步假设，从这个缓冲区检索信息是通过意识觉醒来进行的，这与我们早期关于视觉和听觉意象生动性研究的联系（Baddeley & Andrade 2000）。这导致了一个类似于 Baars (1988) 所提出的意识理论，该理论认为意识作为一个机制，将刺激的特征绑定成为感知到的对象。他使用了一个比喻，将意识比作一个舞台，在这个舞台上，前意识过程的产物 —— 演员，变得可以被意识 —— 观众所感知。

我们的新组件可以被视为我们最初 1974 版本中央执行器（CE）的一个细分，将其分为单独的注意和存储系统。除了提供一个可能的解答来解释长期记忆（LTM）与工作记忆（WM）之间的相互作用外，它还带来了许多其他优势。在理论层面，它构建了一个桥梁，连接了我们基于从外围系统开始的自下而上的方法，与在北美占主导的、更多关注工作记忆的执行和注意方面的自上而下的方法（例如，Cowan 2005, Engle et al. 1999）。可能也是出于这个原因，这一概念受到欢迎并频繁被引用。然而，虽然这表明人们认为它很有用，但要使其在理论上产生成效，我们需要利用它来提出有趣且可行的问题，这一挑战在近年来一直是 Graham Hitch, Richard Allen 和我自己忙碌的焦点。

#### WM and Binding

Like Baars (1988), we assume that a central role of the buffer is to provide a multidimensional medium that allows features from different sources to be bound into chunks or episodes, not only perceptually but also creatively, allowing us to imagine something new, for example, an ice-hockey-playing elephant. We could then reflect on this new concept and decide, for example, whether our elephant would be better doing a mean defensive body check or keeping goal. This all seemed likely to be an attention-demanding process, so we speculated that the buffer would depend heavily on the CE. In the initial (Baddeley 2000) model (see Figure 3), I intentionally required all access to go through the executive, arguing that we could then investigate empirically whether other links were needed.

Figure 3: The model following the introduction of a fourth component, the episodic buffer, a system for integrating information from a range of sources into a multidimensional code (Baddeley 2000).

We studied the role in binding played by each of the three initial components of WM, using our well-tried concurrent task strategy to disrupt each in turn. If, as our initial hypothesis proposed, the CE controls access to and from the buffer, then an attentionally demanding concurrent task should have a very substantial effect on the capacity to bind information, in contrast to minor effects from disrupting the other subsystems.We decided to examine binding in two very different modalities, namely the binding of visual features into perceived objects on one hand, and the binding of words into sentences on the other.

正如 Baars (1988) 所描述，我们认为情景缓冲区扮演的核心角色是提供一个能够将不同来源的特征在多个维度上结合成信息块或情节的平台，这不仅限于感知层面，还包括创造性思维，使我们能够构想出全新的概念，比如一个打冰球的大象。然后，我们可以对这个新颖的概念进行反思，比如决定我们的大象在进行激烈的防守对抗还是担任守门员时哪个更为合适。这整个过程似乎都需要高度集中的注意力，因此我们推测情景缓冲区在很大程度上依赖于中央执行器（CE）。在最初的模型（Baddeley 2000）中（见图3），我特意设计了所有访问必须通过执行器的要求，目的是进一步通过实验研究是否需要其他的连接方式。

我们通过采用我们验证过的并行任务策略来研究工作记忆（WM）最初三个组件在绑定过程中的作用，目的是逐一地检查并干扰每个组件。如果按照我们的初步假设，即中央执行器（CE）控制着进出缓冲区的访问，那么一个要求高度注意力的并行任务应对绑定信息的能力产生显著影响，与干扰其他子系统相比，这种影响应更为显著。我们决定在两种截然不同的模态中检验绑定能力，一是视觉特征到感知对象的绑定，二是单词到句子的绑定，以探索情景缓冲区如何在不同的感知和认知过程中发挥作用。

#### Visual Binding and WM

Our work on visual binding was strongly influenced by some new developments that were beginning to extend the methods applied to the study of visual attention to the subsequent short-term storage of perceived items. A central question of this approach concerned the factors that determine the conditions under which features such as color and shape are integrated and bound into perceived and remembered objects. The basic experimental paradigm was developed by Luck & Vogel (1997, Vogel et al. 2001). As in the work of Phillips (1974), it involved presenting an array of visual stimuli, followed (after a brief delay) by a probe stimulus, with participants deciding whether or not the probe had been in the array. A number of important results emerged, notably including the observation that capacity was limited to about four objects and was approximately the same, regardless of whether participants were remembering only a single feature, for example, color or shape, or were required to bind the two features and remember not only that a red stimulus had been presented, or a square, but also that the two had been bound together as a red square (Vogel et al. 2001). A subsequent study by Wheeler & Treisman (2002) obtained the same result when testing involved a single probe item. However, they found a binding impairment when the memory test required searching through an array of stimuli in order to find a target match, a result they interpreted as suggesting that maintaining the binding of features was attentionally demanding.

We ourselves tested the attentional hypothesis using our concurrent task procedure. Presentation of the stimulus array was accompanied by a demanding task such as counting backward by threes. If the CE is heavily involved in binding, then the concurrent task should prove more detrimental to the binding condition (e.g., remembering a red square) than to either of the single-feature probe tasks (e.g., red or square). We compared the backward counting condition to one involving articulatory suppression. As expected, we found an overall impairment in performance when accompanied by backward counting. However, this was just as great for the single features as for the binding condition.

我们在视觉特征绑定的研究受到了一些创新发展的显著影响，这些发展开始将视觉注意的研究方法扩展到对感知项目之后的短期存储。这种方法核心探讨了在什么条件下颜色和形状等特征能够被整合并绑定成为我们能感知和记忆的对象。Luck & Vogel (1997, Vogel et al. 2001) 开发的基本实验范式涉及展示一系列视觉刺激，之后（短暂延迟后）通过探测刺激，要求参与者判断该探测刺激是否出现在先前的数组中。其中一个关键发现是，无论是记忆单一特征如颜色或形状，还是需要将两种特征绑定并记住一个红色的方形，记忆容量都限制在大约四个对象（Vogel et al. 2001）。Wheeler & Treisman (2002) 在使用单个探测项目进行测试时得到了相同的结果。然而，他们发现当记忆测试要求参与者在一系列刺激中搜索以找到目标匹配时，存在绑定障碍，他们将这一结果解释为维持特征绑定是一个需要注意力的过程。

我们通过并行任务程序来验证这一注意力假设。刺激数组的呈现同时伴随着一个高要求的任务，如向后数数三个。如果中央执行器（CE）在特征绑定中扮演重要角色，则并行任务对于绑定条件（如记住红色方形）的影响应该比对单一特征任务（如记住红色或方形）更为严重。我们将进行向后数数的条件与进行言语抑制的条件进行了比较。正如预期的，我们发现伴随向后数数时整体性能会受损，但这种性能下降对于单一特征和绑定条件的影响是一样的，这意味着并行任务对绑定能力的影响可能不如我们预期的那样与注意力的分配密切相关。

A series of further studies explored this finding, using other concurrent tasks and more demanding binding conditions. In one case, for example, shapes and the color patches to which each shape should be bound were presented in separate locations. In another study, the features to be bound were separated in time, while a third experiment presented one feature visually (e.g., a patch of red) and the associated shape verbally. Although some of these activities led to a lower overall level of performance, in no case did we obtain a differential disruption of binding (see Baddeley et al. 2011 for a review).

The final experiment of the Allen et al. (2006) paper did, however, obtain a differential effect. In this study, colored shapes were presented sequentially, followed by a probe. When the final item was probed, the results were as before: no additional binding deficit. However, earlier items did show poorer retention of bound stimuli. We interpreted this as suggesting that binding did not demand extra attention but that maintaining it against distraction did. We explored this disruption effect further, again using simultaneous presentation, but this time inserting a single additional item that participants were instructed to ignore between presentation and test. Binding was differentially impaired even though participants were told to ignore the suffix, which suggests that although visual binding per se is not attention demanding, maintaining bindings against distraction is (see Baddeley et al. 2011 for an overview).

通过一系列深入研究，我们进一步探讨了这一发现，采用了其他的并行任务和更加严苛的绑定条件。例如，在一项实验中，我们分别在不同位置呈现了形状和应与之绑定的颜色块。另一个实验中，我们把要绑定的特征在时间上进行了分离，而第三个实验则是视觉上呈现了一个特征（如红色块），同时口头描述了相关联的形状。虽然这些实验设置导致了整体性能的下降，但我们在任何情况下都没有观察到绑定过程中的显著差异干扰（参考 Baddeley et al. 2011 的综述）。

然而，Allen et al. (2006) 的最终实验确实显示了差异性效果。在该研究中，通过顺序呈现彩色形状，然后是一个探测刺激。当探针针对最后一项时，结果与之前相同：没有额外的绑定缺陷。但是，对于较早出现的项目，绑定的刺激保留较差。我们认为这表明绑定过程本身并不需要额外的注意力，但是在干扰条件下保持绑定则需要。我们继续探讨这种干扰效应，采用了同时呈现的方法，但这次在呈现和测试之间插入了一个要求参与者忽略的额外项目。即使参与者被告知忽略这个后缀，绑定能力还是受到了明显的损害，这表明尽管视觉绑定本身可能不需要额外的注意力，但要在分心的情况下保持这些绑定则确实需要（参考 Baddeley et al. 2011 的概述）。

#### Binding in Verbal WM

Although it appears that attention may be useful for maintaining visual bindings, our data indicate that the simple binding of color and shape is not itself attention demanding. It could, of course, be argued that perceptual binding is atypical in not requiring central resources. Fortunately, however, as part of our converging operations approach to theory, we had pursued a parallel series of experiments investigating the role of executive processes in the binding of words into chunks during retention of spoken sentences.

We carried out a series of experiments, the results of which can be summarized quite simply (Baddeley et al. 2009). Concurrent tasks involving the visuo-spatial sketchpad had a small but significant effect on recall that increased when they also had a visually based executive component. Simple articulatory suppression had a greater effect that was further amplified when both suppression and attentional load were required. Most importantly, however, none of these tasks differentially disrupted the binding of words into chunks as reflected in magnitude of the advantage in recalling sentences over unrelated word sequences. Hence, just as with visual binding, although concurrent tasks impair overall performance, they do not appear to interfere with the binding process itself, which in the case of sentences, we assume operates relatively automatically in LTM.

虽然注意力似乎对维持视觉上的连接很重要，但我们的研究数据显示，仅仅将颜色和形状结合起来并不需要消耗注意力资源。当然，有人可能会反驳说，在感知的结合中不需要中央处理资源是一种例外。不过幸运的是，作为我们多角度探索理论的一环，我们还开展了一系列并行的实验，这些实验探讨了在记忆过程中，执行控制过程如何参与将单词组织成语句块。

通过一系列实验（Baddeley 等人，2009），我们得到了一个简明的结论。与视觉 - 空间暂存板相关的任务虽然对记忆回忆有轻微但显著的影响，而当这些任务包含视觉执行要素时，这种影响会增加。单纯的口头抑制作用更大，并且当需要同时进行口头抑制和承担注意力负荷时，这种作用会进一步增强。然而，最关键的是，这些任务并没有特别干扰将单词组织成块的过程，这一点从回忆整句话相比记忆无关单词序列时的优势中可以看出。因此，就像视觉连接一样，虽然并行的任务会影响整体的表现，但它们似乎并不干扰组块化过程本身，我们认为，在长期记忆（LTM）中，这一过程是相对自动进行的。

The evidence from both visual and verbal binding is thus inconsistent with the original proposal that the process of binding involves the active manipulation of information within the episodic buffer, which we now regard as being an important but essentially passive structure on which bindings achieved elsewhere can be displayed. It remains important in that it allows executive processes to carry out further manipulation. This may in turn lead to further bindings involving, for example, the binding of phrases into integrated sentences or objects into complex scenes.

In conclusion, although binding is sometimes discussed as if it were a unitary function, we suggest that it differs depending on the specific type of binding involved. For example, binding may be perceptual or linguistic, and it may be temporary, as required to perform WM tasks, or durable, as in the binding of new information to its context in LTM, a capacity that is disrupted in amnesic patients, who may nonetheless show normal binding in WM (Baddeley et al. 2010). All of these types of binding may, however, result in bound representations accessible through the episodic buffer.

因此，无论是从视觉还是语言的结合来看，现有的证据都与最初的假设相悖，即结合过程涉及在情景缓冲区内主动处理信息。现在我们认为，情景缓冲区是一个重要但基本上是被动的结构，它可以展示在其他地方实现的结合。其重要性在于，它允许执行控制过程进一步操纵信息。这可能进一步促使发生更多的结合，比如将短语结合成完整的句子或者将对象结合成复杂的场景。

总的来说，虽然绑定有时被视为一个统一的功能，我们认为它根据涉及的特定绑定类型而有所差异。例如，绑定可以是感知上的或语言上的，它可以是短暂的，比如执行工作记忆任务时所需的，或者是持久的，如在长期记忆中将新信息与其上下文相绑定的能力，这种能力在失忆症患者中会受到影响，尽管他们可能在工作记忆中保持正常的绑定能力（Baddeley 等人，2010）。然而，所有这些绑定的类型最终都可能通过情景缓冲区获得的绑定表示。

LINKING LONG-TERM AND WORKING MEMORY

#### Is WM Just Activated LTM?

A number of approaches describe WM as activated LTM (e.g., Cowan 2005, Ruchkin et al. 2003). My view on this issue is that working memory involves the activation of many areas of the brain that involve LTM. This is also true of language, for which activated LTM is not taken as an explanation. I assume that in the case of Cowan's (2005) model, it is a way of referring to those aspects of WM that are not his current principal concern and not a denial of a need for further explanation. He and I would, I think, agree that the phonological loop, the simplest component of WM, is likely to depend on phonological and lexical representations within LTM as well as procedurally based language habits for rehearsal.

工作记忆，不过是长期记忆的一种激活状态？

多种研究方法将工作记忆视为一种被激活的长期记忆状态（例如，Cowan 在 2005 年的研究，以及 Ruchkin 等人在 2003 年的工作）。在我看来，工作记忆的确牵涉到大脑中多个与长期记忆相关的区域的激活。这一点在语言处理上尤为明显，尽管我们并不将激活的长期记忆作为解释语言过程的唯一方式。以 Cowan（2005）的模型为例，他似乎是在指向那些当前不是他主要研究焦点的工作记忆方面，并不是说我们不需要进一步探究。我相信他和我都认同，工作记忆中最基本的组成部分 —— 语音回路，很可能依赖于长期记忆中的语音和词汇表征，以及为复述而形成的基于程序的语言习惯。

#### Long-Term WM

Ericsson & Kintsch (1995) proposed this concept in explaining the superior performance of expert mnemonists, going on to extend it to the use of semantic and linguistic knowledge to boost memory performance. They argue that these and other situations utilize previously developed structures in LTM as a means of boosting WM performance. I agree, but I cannot see any advantage in treating this as a different kind of WM rather than a particularly clear example of the way in which WM and LTM interact.

Figure 4: My current view of the complex and multiple links between working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM).

长效工作记忆

Ericsson 和 Kintsch 在 1995 年提出了这一概念，旨在解释专业记忆大师们卓越的记忆表现，并进一步将其应用于通过语义和语言知识增强记忆表现的情况。他们认为，这些情况都利用了长期记忆中预先形成的结构来增强工作记忆的表现。我对此表示赞同，但我不认为有必要将其视作一种与工作记忆不同的记忆类型，而应该看作是工作记忆与长期记忆相互作用的一个典型例证。

图 4：我目前对工作记忆（WM）与长期记忆（LTM）之间复杂而多样的联系的理解。

#### LTM and the Multicomponent Model

It seems likely that some of the misunderstandings confronting M-WM stem from the rather limited links with LTM shown inFigures 2 and 3. This was also reflected in a disagreement between myself and Robert Logie, who insisted that all information entered the sketchpad via LTM. It was only when I tried to represent my views in the simple model shown in Figure 4 that we found we agreed. Incoming information is processed by systems that themselves are influenced by LTM. I seeWM as a complex interactive system that is able to provide an interface between cognition and action, an interface that is capable of handling information in a range of modalities and stages of processing.

长期记忆与多成分模型

M-WM 所遭遇的一些误解可能源自于在图 2 和图 3 中展示的与长期记忆的联系较为有限。这一点也体现在我与 Robert Logie 之间的争论中，他坚持认为所有信息都是通过长期记忆进入「素描本」的。只有当我尝试用图 4 所展示的简化模型来表达我的观点时，我们发现了共识。信息的处理是由受到长期记忆影响的系统来完成的。我认为，工作记忆是一个复杂的交互系统，它为认知和行为之间提供了一个界面，这个界面能够处理多种模态和不同阶段的信息。

### 07

NEUROBIOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO WORKING MEMORY

The development of my own views on WM has been strongly influenced by the study of patients with neuropsychological deficits, and particularly by patients with specific impairment in the absence of general cognitive deficits. Brain damage can be seen scientifically as producing a series of unfortunate experiments of nature. Nature is not usually a good experimenter: Patients typically have a range of different deficits, but just occasionally "pure" deficits occur that potentially, given careful and thorough investigation, allow clear theoretical conclusions to be drawn. These can then be extended to help diagnose and treat patients with related but more complex disabilities.

There are two aspects of such research: the behavioral, linking the performance of the patient to cognitive psychology, and the neurobiological, linking it to its anatomical and neurophysiological basis. Both are important and will ultimately be combined. However, my own expertise and current concern is for the behavioral and the extent to which neurobiological research has so far contributed to the cognitive understanding of M-WM.

我的工作记忆观点的形成深受神经心理学缺损患者研究的影响，尤其是那些在无广泛认知缺损背景下表现出特定障碍的患者研究。科学角度看，脑损伤仿佛是自然界不幸的实验场景。然而，自然并不总能成为一位优秀的实验者：患者往往表现出多种不同的缺损，但偶尔我们也会遇到一些「纯粹」的案例，这些案例在经过细致和全面的研究后，能够为我们提供清晰的理论洞见。这些洞见随后能帮助我们更好地诊断和治疗那些面临更复杂障碍的患者。

这项研究包括两个重要方面：一是行为学方面，它把患者的表现与认知心理学相连；二是神经生物学方面，它探讨患者表现背后的解剖学和神经生理学基础。这两个方面都极其重要，最终将被整合在一起。然而，我个人的专业领域和目前的重点是研究行为学方面，以及迄今为止神经生物学研究如何助力我们深化对工作记忆机制的认知理解。

There is no doubt that the popularity of the concept of WM owes a great deal to neurobiological studies that appear to suggest that WM may depend on one or more specific anatomical locations. Single-unit recording of the brains of awake monkeys performing a visual STM task found that continued activation of cells in the frontal cortex was associated with successful recall, and disrupted activation was associated with failure (Goldman-Rakic 1988). This led some to conclude that it reflected a specific frontal location of WM. My own view was that it probably formed part of a complex circuit underpinning the visuo-spatial sketchpad. Subsequent discovery of similar cells elsewhere in the brain is consistent with this view.

A second source of apparent support for the concept ofWM came from neuroimaging when the various subsystems of M-WM appeared to be relatively closely localizable (for reviews, see Henson 2001, Smith & Jonides 1997). This led to a large number of further neuroimaging investigations from many different laboratories, producing a range of different results, which when fed into a meta-analysis often failed to show a consistent pattern (see Baddeley 2007, chapter 7). My own view is that this simply reflects the unreliability of such results and the complexity of WM, as well as the need to modify paradigms to fit the constraints of neuroimaging, for example, avoiding overt speech.

A different interpretation is offered by Jonides et al. (2008), who comment on the "near-revolutionary changes in psychological theories about STM, with similarly great advances in the neurosciences" that have occurred in the past decade. Their very ambitious interpretation of the "mind and brain of STM" is discussed below. More generally, although I think it is very important to understand the neurobiological basis of WM, I am not yet convinced that it has made a major contribution to psychological theories of WM. This does not reflect a general rejection of neuroimaging, which offers an essential and potentially powerful tool for understanding cognition and its neural basis. There are some important areas, such as those investigating conscious awareness, in which neuroimaging provides a crucial component in testing and potentially validating distinctions such as that between "remembering" and "knowing" (D¨uzel et al. 2001). In the case of WM, however, I have two major sources of doubt. The first concerns the lack of apparent replicability in the field. The second more basic concern is the validity of the assumption that anatomical localization will provide a firm theoretical basis for a system as complex as WM in the absence of a much better understanding of the temporal structure of activation than is typically available at present.

工作记忆（WM）概念之所以受到广泛关注，很大程度上是因为神经生物学研究显示，工作记忆可能依赖于大脑中的一个或多个特定区域。例如，1988 年 Goldman-Rakic 对执行视觉短时记忆任务的清醒猴子进行的研究发现，前额皮层细胞的持续激活与记忆成功相关，而激活中断则与失败相关。这让一些研究者认为，这可能反映了工作记忆在前额皮质的特定位置。而我认为，这很可能是构成视觉空间记事本的复杂电路中的一部分。随后在大脑其他地方发现的类似细胞进一步支持了这一观点。

另一方面，神经影像学研究似乎也为工作记忆的概念提供了支持，显示 M-WM 的不同子系统似乎可以相对精确地定位。然而，来自不同实验室的大量神经影像学研究产生了多种结果，当这些结果进行元分析时，往往并未展现出一致的模式。我认为，这只是反映了这些研究结果的不稳定性和工作记忆的复杂性，以及在使用神经影像学方法时需要调整实验设计以适应其限制的必要性。

Jonides 等人在 2008 年提出了一个不同的观点，他们指出过去十年在短时记忆的心理理论及神经科学领域发生了巨大的变革。他们对「短时记忆的心智和大脑」的解释极富野心。一般而言，虽然我认为理解工作记忆的神经生物学基础非常重要，但我还未被说服它对工作记忆的心理学理论做出了重大贡献。这并不意味着我完全拒绝神经影像学 —— 它为理解认知及其神经基础提供了一个必不可少且强大的工具。在一些领域，如意识研究，神经影像学是区分「记忆」与「知晓」等概念的关键工具。然而，在工作记忆的研究中，我持有两大疑虑：一是该领域研究结果的可重复性不足；二是假设通过解剖定位可以为如此复杂的系统提供坚实理论基础的有效性，尤其是在我们对激活时间结构的理解尚不充分的情况下。

SOME ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

#### Theories of STM

A good deal of the controversy surrounding M-WM concerns those aspects associated with STM rather than WM, and in particular with the phonological loop model. Whereas some are concerned with the specifics of the model, such as trace decay, for example, other concerns stem from a difference in purpose. Much of our own work has focused on analyzing one source of short-term storage, that based on phonological coding. That means using tasks that minimize semantic and other longer-term factors. Other theorists focus on the whole range of codes that may be contributing, as in the case of Nairne's (1990) feature model. These will inevitably include long-term factors such as semantic coding and will emphasize the similarities between STM and LTM. I regard these two approaches as complementary.

短时记忆（STM）的理论讨论往往集中在与 STM 而非工作记忆（WM）相关的特定方面，特别是围绕语音循环模型的讨论。一方面，一些研究者专注于模型的具体细节，比如信息的衰减过程；而另一方面，不同观点的差异则源于研究目的的不同。我们的研究主要探究了基于语音编码的短期存储来源，即通过最小化语义和其他长期影响因素的任务来进行研究。与此同时，其他理论家则试图考虑所有可能的编码类型，比如 Nairne 在 1990 年提出的特征模型。这种方法不可避免地会纳入诸如语义编码这样的长期因素，并强调 STM 与 LTM 之间的相似性。我认为这两种方法是相辅相成的。

#### Theories of WM

There are a number of ambitious models of WM that I regard as broadly consistent with the multicomponent framework, although each has a different emphasis and terminology.

关于工作记忆（WM）的理论也不乏宏伟的模型，我认为这些模型大致与多组分框架一致，尽管每种模型都有其独特的重点和术语。

#### Cowan's Embedded Processes Theory

Cowan defines WM as "cognitive processes that are maintained in an unusually accessible state" (Cowan 1999, p. 62). His theory involves a limited-capacity attentional focus that operates across areas of activated LTM. A central issue for Cowan over recent years has been to specify the capacity of this attentional focus and hence the capacity of WM. He produces extensive evidence to suggest that, unlike an earlier suggestion of seven items, the capacity is much closer to four. Importantly, however, this is four chunks or episodes, each of which may contain more than a single item (Cowan 2005).

At a superficial level, Cowan's theories might seem to be totally different from my own. In practice, however, we agree on most issues but differ in our terminology and areas of current focus. I see Cowan's model as principally concerned, in my terminology, with the link between the CE and the episodic buffer. Cowan refers to the material on which his system works as "activated LTM" but does not treat this as providing an adequate explanation, accepting the need for a more detailed analysis of the processes operating beyond attentional focus as reflected in his extensive and influential work on verbal STM, research that interacts with and is complementary to the phonological loop hypothesis of verbal STM (e.g., Cowan et al. 1992). I regard our differences as principally ones of emphasis and terminology.

Cowan 的嵌入式过程理论定义工作记忆为「处于异常可访问状态的认知过程」。他的理论包含了一个有限容量的注意力焦点，这个焦点贯穿于被激活的长期记忆（LTM）的各个区域。Cowan 近年来的一个核心研究课题是确定这个注意力焦点的容量，从而推断工作记忆的容量。他提供的大量证据显示，与早期认为的七项相比，实际容量更接近于四项。然而，重要的是，这「四项」指的是块或情节，每个块或情节可能包含多于一个项目。

表面上，Cowan 的理论似乎与我的理论完全不同。然而，实际上，我们在大多数问题上都持有共识，仅在术语和当前关注点上有所区别。我认为 Cowan 的模型主要关注的是中央执行器和情境缓冲器之间的联系。Cowan 将他系统操作的内容称为「被激活的 LTM」，但他也认识到这并不足以提供充分的解释，而需要进一步深入分析注意力焦点之外的过程。这一点在他关于语言短时记忆研究的广泛而有影响力的工作中得到了体现，这些研究与语音循环模型的语言 STM 假设相互补充。我认为我们之间的差异主要在于重点和术语的不同。

#### Individual Difference–Based Theories

The demonstration by Daneman & Carpenter (1980) that WM-span measures can predict comprehension has provided a major focus of research on WM over the past 30 years, involving multiple replications and extensions (Daneman & Merikle 1996). At a theoretical level, there has been considerable interest in identifying the feature of such complex span measures that allows them to predict cognitive performance so effectively. Purely correlational approaches to this issue have a number of limitations, and in my view, the most promising work in this area comes from combining experimental and correlational methods to tackle the question of why some people are better able to sustain material under these complex conditions. Some explanations focus on the capacity to utilize gaps between the processing operations of the span task in order to maintain a fading memory trace (Barrouillet et al. 2004). Others also assume the need to resist time-based decay but emphasize efficiency at switching between the various tasks involved in span (Towse et al. 2000) or they emphasize the role of interference rather than decay (Saito & Miyake 2004).

However, the most extensively developed theoretical account of the mechanisms underpinningWM capacity is that proposed by Engle and colleagues (Engle et al. 1999, Engle & Kane 2004). They emphasize the importance of inhibitory processes, which they argue are crucial to shielding the memory content from potential disruption. Much of their work involves a combination of individual difference and experimental approaches, typically initially testing a large group of participants and then selecting two subgroups, those with very high and those with very low WM span. They have demonstrated that such groups differ not only in WM performance but also in susceptibility to interference across tasks ranging from recall from episodic LTM, through the capacity to generate items from a semantic category, to performance on an antisaccade task of eye movement control (for a review, see Engle & Kane 2004). Although this is an impressive program of work, I suspect that a theory of executive processing based entirely on inhibitory control may be a little narrow. Control is clearly important, but I suspect people also differ in more positive aspects of attentional capacity.

In general, I would see most of the models of WM based on individual differences as consistent with the broad M-WM framework typically focusing on executive control but accepting the contribution of separate visual and verbal STM components (see Alloway et al. 2006 for an example of such a model). Once again, overall similarities may be obscured by terminological differences. Engle and colleagues (Unsworth & Engle 2007) have recently reverted to an earlier distinction between primary and secondary memory, which I would interpret in terms of the distinction between the fluid and crystallized systems that reflect temporary structural representations in the M-WM model (see Figure 2).

Daneman 和 Carpenter 在 1980 年展示的研究发现，工作记忆跨度测量能够预测理解能力，这一发现在过去 30 年内成为了工作记忆研究的一个核心焦点，并引发了多次复制和拓展研究。在理论层面，人们极为关注这些复杂的跨度测量特征如何能如此有效地预测认知表现。单纯的相关性研究方法存在许多限制，我认为，结合实验和相关性方法来探讨为什么有些人能在这些复杂条件下更好地维持信息，是这一领域最有希望的工作方向。一些解释侧重于在跨度任务的处理操作间隙中维持衰减记忆痕迹的能力，而其他解释则假设需要抵抗基于时间的衰减，但更强调在跨度任务涉及的各种任务之间切换的效率，或是强调干扰的作用而非衰减。

然而，最为深入发展的关于工作记忆容量基础机制的理论是由 Engle 及其同事提出的。他们强调抑制过程的重要性，认为这对于保护记忆内容免遭潜在干扰至关重要。他们的研究结合了个体差异和实验方法，典型地先对大量参与者进行测试，然后根据工作记忆跨度选择极高和极低的两个子组。他们证明，这些组别不仅在工作记忆表现上存在差异，也在抗干扰能力上有所不同，这种差异贯穿于从情景长期记忆回忆到语义类别生成项，再到控制眼动的反扫视任务等多种任务。尽管这是一系列令人印象深刻的研究工作，但我怀疑仅基于抑制控制的执行处理理论可能过于狭隘。控制确实重要，但我认为，人们在注意力容量的更积极方面也存在差异。

总体而言，我认为大多数基于个体差异的工作记忆模型与广义的 M-WM 框架是一致的，这些模型通常关注执行控制，但也认可视觉和语言短时记忆组件的独立贡献。Engle 及其同事最近恢复了主要记忆与次要记忆之间的早期区分，我将这一区分解释为 M-WM 模型中临时结构表征的流体与结晶系统之间的区别。尽管总体上的相似性可能因术语的不同而被隐藏，这一点再次表明了在理论框架和术语选择上的多样性。

#### Jonides and the Mind and Brain of STM

This approach ( Jonides et al. 2008) is strongly influenced by neuroimaging in assuming, for each of a range of modalities, that perception, STM, and LTM are all performed in the same anatomical locations. They also cite evidence from neuropsychology, suggesting that amnesic patients have a general difficulty in binding features together (Hannula et al. 2006, Olson et al. 2006). However, this evidence has been criticized on two grounds: first, that the measures used comprise both long- and short-term components (Shrager et al. 2008), and second, that the conclusions are based on spatial binding. There is strong evidence that both spatial processing and episodic LTM depend on the hippocampus. Nonspatial binding such as that of color to shape was not found to be impaired in a hippocampally compromised amnesic patient (Baddeley et al. 2010), whereas classic amnesic patients do not appear to show evidence of aWM deficit (Baddeley &Warrington 1970, Squire 2004). Furthermore, developmental amnesic patient Jon, who has greatly reduced hippocampal volume, performs well on a range of complex WM tasks (Baddeley et al. 2011).

The major source of evidence cited by Jonides et al. comes from neuroimaging, where STM tasks often activate areas of the brain that also are involved in LTM (e.g., Ruchkin et al. 2003). However, as Jonides et al. note in their discussion of the single-unit studies, the fact that an area becomes active during a given task does not mean that it is essential for performance on that task. Presenting a word is likely to activate regions responsible for its phonological, articulatory, lexical, and semantic dimensions, but that does not mean that all these are necessary in order to repeat that word. Potentially more powerful evidence exists based on lesions in neuropsychological patients (Olson et al. 2006), but the interpretation of this has been questioned (Baddeley et al. 2010); the classic neuropsychological literature typically reports a dissociation between perceptual and memory deficits (Shallice 1988).

The "mind and brain" model proposed by Jonides et al. is somewhat complex, involving five psychological assumptions and six assumptions about neurobiological processing levels. They go on to illustrate their model, using the case of remembering three visual items over a two-second delay, resulting in a figure that involves 13 psychological processes operating across 10 neural levels. I remain somewhat skeptical as to how productive such a model will prove to be. This reflects a difference between us in theoretical style, with my own preference for the gradual development of detailed modes within a broad theoretical framework, whereas Jonides et al. are rather more ambitious.

这项由 Jonides 等人在 2008 年提出的研究方法，深受神经成像技术的影响。它假定在不同感官模态中，感知、短期记忆（Short-term Memory, STM）和长期记忆（Long-term Memory, LTM）都发生在大脑相同的解剖位置。研究还引用神经心理学的证据，指出失忆症患者在将不同特征结合在一起时普遍存在困难（如 Hannula 等人 2006 年和 Olson 等人 2006 年的研究）。但是，这些发现受到了两方面的批评：一是使用的测量方法既包含长期成分也包含短期成分（Shrager 等人 2008 年的批评）；二是结论主要基于空间特征的关联。确实有强有力的证据显示，空间处理和情节性长期记忆都依赖海马体。但在海马体功能受损的失忆症患者中，并未发现色彩与形状这类非空间特征结合受到影响（Baddeley 等人 2010 年），而传统失忆症患者似乎也不表现出工作记忆（Working Memory, WM）的缺失（Baddeley 和 Warrington 1970 年，Squire 2004 年）。更进一步，一个名为 Jon 的发育性失忆症患者，尽管其海马体体积显著减小，但在多项复杂工作记忆任务上的表现却相当不错（Baddeley 等人 2011 年）。

Jonides 等人引用的主要证据来源于神经成像领域，这些研究显示执行短期记忆任务时，大脑中也参与长期记忆处理的区域同样被激活（例如，Ruchkin 等人 2003 年的研究）。然而，正如 Jonides 等人在他们的单元研究讨论中所指出的，一个脑区在特定任务中的活跃，并不意味着它对完成任务是必不可少的。提出一个词可能会激活负责其音韵、发音、词汇和语义的脑区，但这并不意味着所有这些维度都是重复该词所必需的。基于神经心理学患者损伤的证据可能更具说服力（Olson 等人 2006 年），但这种解释遭到了质疑（Baddeley 等人 2010 年）；传统神经心理学文献通常报告了感知与记忆缺陷之间的分离（Shallice 1988 年）。

Jonides 等人提出的「心智与大脑」模型较为复杂，包含五个心理学假设和六个神经生物学处理层面的假设。他们以记住三个视觉项目在两秒钟延迟中的案例来阐释他们的模型，揭示了在十个神经层级中进行的十三个心理过程。我对这个模型能够带来的成效持有保留态度。这反映了我们在理论建构风格上的不同，我更倾向于在宽泛的理论框架内逐步发展详细的模式，而 Jonides 等人的目标则更为远大。

#### Computational Models of WM

The WM theorists discussed so far have all taken a broad-based approach to theory. There are, however, theorists who attempt a much more detailed account of WM, typically accompanied by computer simulation. This is a very flexible approach, giving rise to a range of different models of WM, which can on occasion result in subcomponents resembling aspects of M-WM including the sketch pad (Anderson et al. 2004, p. 1037) and the loop (Anderson et al. 1996).

Barnard's (1985) ambitious computationally based "interacting cognitive subsystems" model can also be mapped directly onto MWM. It was initially developed to account for language processing but was subsequently used extensively by Barnard to analyze situations involving human–computer interaction (Barnard 1987). The model can simulate most aspects of WM while linking it to motor control, emotion, and levels of awareness as part of a broad, ambitious, and insightful model, which in Barnard's hands has been applied with success to an impressive range of situations from choreography to theories of depression (Teasdale & Barnard 1993). However, the sheer complexity of the model makes it difficult for others to use. It is also unclear how important the computational detail really is, and indeed whether it gives an adequate account of what is happening within the more peripheral subcomponents. In discussing his attempt to produce a full simulation of the model, Howard Bowman (2011), a computer scientist who had worked with Barnard in a simulation, now advocates a hierarchical decomposition of the model using components that can be built in isolation, avoiding unnecessary detail such as premature attempts to specify at a neural level.

迄今为止我们讨论的工作记忆（Working Memory, WM）理论家们基本采取了一个广泛的理论研究方法。然而，也存在一些理论家，他们尝试提供一个更加详细的工作记忆描述，通常这会伴随着计算机模拟的应用。这种方法极具灵活性，因此诞生了各种不同的工作记忆模型，有时这些模型会包括一些类似于模块化工作记忆（Modular Working Memory, M-WM）的子组件，比如草图板（Anderson 等人 2004 年的研究，第 1037 页）和回路（Anderson 等人 1996 年的研究）。

Barnard 在 1985 年提出的「互动认知子系统（Interacting Cognitive Subsystems）」模型，是一个基于计算的雄心勃勃的计划，它可以直接对应到模块化工作记忆。最初这个模型是为了解释语言处理而开发的，但 Barnard 后来将其广泛应用于分析人机交互的场景（Barnard 1987 年的工作）。这个模型不仅能模拟工作记忆的大多数方面，还将其与运动控制、情感以及意识水平联系起来，构成了一个广阔、具有远见和洞察力的框架。在 Barnard 的手中，这个模型成功地被应用于从编舞到抑郁症理论等多种情境（Teasdale 和 Barnard 1993 年的研究）。然而，这个模型的复杂性让其他研究者难以采用。同时，这种计算上的细节到底有多重要，以及它是否真的能充分解释更边缘子组件内部发生的情况，这些都还存在疑问。在讨论他尝试全面模拟该模型的过程中，曾与 Barnard 合作进行模拟研究的计算机科学家 Howard Bowman 在 2011 年提出，应当通过可以独立构建的组件，对模型进行层次分解，从而避免不必要的细节，例如过早地在神经水平上进行规定。

I suspect that undue complexity may in due course also prove to be a problem for an ambitious new model proposed by Oberauer (2010), who attempts to provide a blueprint for the whole WM system. He sees the main focus of WM as being "to serve as a blackboard for information processing on which we can construct new representations with little interference from old memories." He proposes six requirements for a WM system, namely, (a) maintaining structural representations by dynamic bindings, (b) manipulating them, (c) flexibly reconfiguring them, (d ) partially decoupling these from LTM, (e) controlling LTM retrieval, and ( f ) encoding new structures into LTM. He postulates mechanisms for achieving each of these, hence attempting to put flesh on the previously vague concept of "activated LTM."

A crucial feature of Oberauer's model is the distinction he makes between declarative and procedural WM. Declarative WM is the aspect of WM of which we are aware, comprising most of the current work in the area, whereas proceduralWM is concerned with the nondeclarative processes that underpin such operations: I assume that an example would be the process controlling subvocal rehearsal. However, he also considers a higher level of procedural control through what he refers to as the "bridge," as in the bridge of a ship, and what I myself would call the central executive. Consider the following: A participant in my experiment is instructed to press the red button when the number 1 appears, press the green for number 2, and neither for 3. We would expect this simple instruction to be followed throughout the experiment. It is as if some mini-program is set up and then runs, but we currently know very little about how this is achieved. I think the investigation of this aspect of procedural working memory, sometimes referred to as "task set," will become increasingly influential.

This is certainly a very ambitious program, and as Oberauer points out, the evidence at present is rather sparse, but it could be an exciting development. However, the sheer complexity of the model may make it difficult to evaluate experimentally. But then, I am a theoretical mapmaker and temperamentally skeptical of complex theoretical architectures. Time will tell.

WHAT NEXT?

#### A Speculative Model and Some Questions

I have described my attempts to turn a broad theoretical framework into a more detailed model by a process of speculation followed by empirical exploration. It is therefore perhaps appropriate to end on my own current speculations and some of the many questions they raise.

As Figure 5 shows, my current views are not dramatically different from our original speculation, apart from the episodic buffer, and the attempt to provide considerably more speculative detail. In each case this suggests questions that will not be easily answered but that potentially offer a way forward. I consider the various components in turn.

Figure 5: A speculative view of the flow of information from perception to working memory. VSSP, visuo-spatial sketchpad.

Central executive. This is an attentional system; how does it differ from the limitedcapacity component of Cowan's (2005) model? I assume that it comprises a number of executive functions, but how many, and how are they organized and interrelated? Just how far can one take attempts to explain executive control in terms of a single factor such as that of inhibition? Do we need to worry about precisely what is being inhibited and whether this differs between individuals? Do we need a concept of cognitive energy?





Episodic buffer. How should we measure its capacity? To what extent is this limited by number of chunks and to what extent by similarity between chunks? If similarity is important, can other modalities such as smell and taste be added without impacting visual or verbal capacity? Are there separate subsystems for smell and taste? How is rehearsal maintained? My current speculation is that it operates according to the principle of attentionally based refreshing, as discussed by Johnson et al. (2002). What about emotion? Elsewhere (Baddeley 2007) I have suggested that it impacts WM via a hedonic detector system; where within the M-WM system is this located?

I assume that the buffer provides access to conscious awareness; does this mean that we are not directly aware of the other subsystems but only of their products when registered in the buffer?

Phonological loop. Can we reach a conclusion on the ancient trace decay/interference controversy? Is subvocal rehearsal atypical of other types of rehearsal, as I suspect? To what extent is the loop used for remembering nonverbal material such as music or environmental sounds?

Visuo-spatial sketchpad. The visual and spatial aspects appear to be clearly separable but linked within the sketchpad; is this true of haptic, tactile, and kinesthetic memory? What is the mechanism of visuo-spatial rehearsal? Is it a spatial analogue to the phonological loop, as Logie (1995) suggests, or is it more like attentionally based refreshing? Finally, given that our attempt to link the loop with LTM through language acquisition proved very fruitful, would pursuing the link between the sketchpad and LTM prove equally useful?

#### Integration

Finally, how do these increasingly detailed accounts fit together to provide an interactive unitary system that mediates between perception, LTM, and action?

#### In Praise of Negative Results

It is of course very easy to raise questions, but much more difficult to answer them. This can lead to a program that cautiously seeks easy confirmation of what we are pretty sure we already know, resulting in confirmation bias, and an avoidance of too much risk of negative results. Negative results are a pain for a number of reasons. First of all, they are hard to interpret. They could result from a poor design or sloppy experimentation. They also raise the question of whether the experiment has sufficient power and indeed whether the question is worth asking in the first place, with all these factors making negative results harder to publish. If we are to understand WM, however, it is important to know what it does not do, and this is likely to involve negative results, as has often proved to be the case in the various stages of developing the current M-WM model. Publication is justifiably more difficult, and there needs to be a good justification for the question. Negative results can, however, be very important and publishable, provided the problem of sensitivity is addressed through inclusion of other conditions showing positive effects together with clear evidence of replication. This was the case with our original 1974 studies, where the effect of concurrent tasks was much less than anticipated, and even more so in our recent exploration of the episodic buffer (Baddeley et al. 2009, 2011).

So what does WM not do? My own conclusion after surveying the experimental literature and its implications for clinical and social psychology (Baddeley 2007) is that we have evolved an overall cognitive system that attempts to minimize the demands made on WM while allowing it to intervene where necessary. A very basic example is that of breathing, far too important to be left to working memory. However, as any diver or singer will know, we clearly do have considerable, though limited, control. Suicide by breath holding is not an option.




#### Applications

A central requirement of our original framework was that it should be applicable outside the laboratory. Although I have not discussed this aspect of M-WM, it does appear to have had success in achieving this, at two levels. First, through direct application of the M-WM framework to specific practical problems, Gathercole's extensive development of a WM measure applied to school-aged children has been successful in identifying children at risk and providing methods of helping teachers identify and help children with WM problems (Gathercole & Alloway 2008). Another instance is the development and validation of a dual-task performance measure for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (Kaschel et al. 2009, Logie et al. 2004).

A second aspect of theoretical application is the use of the M-WM theory as a tool for investigating and understanding other research areas. Here the applications are very extensive, ranging from human factors to psychiatry, neuropharmacology to language therapy, and even to paleoanthropology, where the development of working memory is proposed as an explanation of the differences between Neanderthal man and homo sapiens, suggested by a study of surviving artifacts (Wynn & Coolidge 2010).

My own view is that this breadth of application has reflected the simplicity of the theoretical framework together with the availability of a few basic methodologies, such as the use of similarity effects as an indication of coding dimension and of dual-task performance as a way of controlling processing. Such techniques are easily learned, and while not guaranteeing fruitful answers, do at least provide conceptual and practical tools for investigating a wide range of problems. From a theoretical viewpoint, such practical applications can be extremely valuable both in helping explore the boundaries of the laboratory-based effects and in highlighting theoretical anomalies that have the potential to become future growing points.

CONCLUSION

So where does this leave our early question of what makes a good theory? Clearly, my own preference has been for Toulmin's view of theories as maps, coupled with the Lakatos criterion of judging success by productiveness rather than predictive accuracy. However, as we begin to fill in the empty spaces on the theoretical map, it hopefully will be increasingly possible to develop interlinked and more detailed models of the components of WM and their mode of interaction.
