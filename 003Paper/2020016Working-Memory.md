## Working Memory

The term "working memory" refers to the temporary storage of information in connection with the performance of other cognitive tasks such as reading, problem-solving or learning. It is here conceptualized as comprising a limited-capacity central processor, the central executive, which employs a number of subsidiary slave systems. Evidence for this view is presented, together with a more detailed account of two such systems: the articulatory loop, which stores and manipulates speech-based material, and the visuo-spatial scratch-pad, which is responsible for creating and maintaining visual imagery.

工作记忆是一个关键的心理学概念，它描述了人们在进行阅读、解题或学习等认知活动时，暂时存储和处理信息的能力。这一过程涉及一个有限能力的中心处理单元 —— 中央执行器（central executive），它控制和协调一些辅助系统的工作。研究支持这一理论，并详细介绍了两个辅助系统：语音回路（articulatory loop），它负责存储和处理语言信息；视觉空间草图板（visuo-spatial scratch-pad），则负责生成和保持视觉图像。

### 01. Introduction

Although the term "working memory" has only gradually achieved popularity, temporary storage in human memory has been an area of active theoretical interest for at least 25 years It is easy to look back on the area as producing a series of controversies each of which flared into activity only to fade away. But underlying these there is a continuity of development whereby the initial assumption of a unitary memory system was elaborated into a dichotomy between long-term and short-term memory, both of which were subsequently subdivided: long-term memory into semantic and episodic memory (Tulving 1972) and short-term memory into a range of subsystems. Collectively, the latter are called "working memory", an alliance of separate but interacting temporary storage systems, possibly coordinated by a single central executive component. 

Although this conception can on the one hand be seen as a departure from the classic concept of short-term memory, many of the components and characteristics of working memory bear a striking resemblance to those of earlier models extending back to Broadbents influential initial model (Broadbent 1958). Because I believe that it is important to emphasize the continuity, I shall devote the first part of this paper to an overview of the development of the concept of short-term memory into the broader concept of working memory, before going on to outline my own views on the probable structure and function of working memory.

尽管「工作记忆」这个术语逐渐变得广为人知，人类记忆中的临时存储问题在过去至少 25 年里一直是心理学研究的热点。回顾这一领域，我们可以看到一系列争论的出现和消退，但穿越这些争论的，是一个由单一记忆系统向长期记忆与短期记忆二元结构演化，再到进一步将这两者细分为语义记忆、情景记忆（Tulving, 1972）和一系列短期记忆子系统的连续发展过程。这些短期记忆子系统的集合被称为「工作记忆」，它们是一系列独立但相互交互的临时存储系统，可能由一个中心执行部件统一协调。

虽然这种看法在某种程度上标志着对传统短期记忆概念的转变，但工作记忆的组成部分和特征与早期的模型有着显著的相似性，这些早期模型最早可以追溯到 Broadbent 在 1958 年的开创性工作。因此，强调这一理论的连续性非常重要。本文的第一部分将回顾短期记忆概念如何演化为工作记忆的更广泛概念，之后我将分享我对工作记忆结构和功能的看法。

### 02. One Memorty System or Two?

Although the possibility of two separate types of memory had been suggested as early as 1883 by Francis Galton, the argument for a functional separation between long-term and short-term memory first achieved prominence through the work of Broadbent (1958), who strongly advocated the dichotomy, and the influential counter-argument by Melton  (1963), who defended a unitary concept of memory. This in turn led to a search for empirical evidence for or against the dichotomy. This literature has been reviewed elsewhere (e. G. By Baddeley 1976) but includes the following sources of evidence in favour of a separation between long-term and short-term memory.

1. Two-component tasks. A number of tasks yielded data suggesting that they comprised two memory components, a relatively stable long-term component, and a much more labile short-term component (Glanzer 1972; Peterson 1966; Waugh Norman 1965).

2. Neuropsychological evidence. It has been known at least since the 1940s (Zangwill 1946) that patients suffering from the Korsakoff syndrome exhibit profoundly disturbed long-term learning capacity that may nevertheless be accompanied by a normal memory span, as measured by the ability to repeat back a sequence of digits or words. 

    Milner (1966) pointed out that the classic amnesic patient H.M. Also appeared to show a dissociation between immediate memory and long-term memory, while a study by Baddeley & Warrington (1970) examined the performance of a number of amnesic patients on tasks assumed to reflect separate short-term and long-term memory components. The results supported the dichotomy suggesting normal short-term memory but impaired long-term memory.

    Further evidence for neurological dissociation was presented by Shallice & Warrington  (1970), who described a patient having the opposite characteristics, normal long-term learning ability, coupled with an immediate memory span of only two items.

3. Diferential coding. Evidence from the immediate memory span task suggested that short-term memory relied heavily on some form of speech coding, representing the sound or articulatory characteristics of the material but not its meaning. Errors tend to be phonologically similar to the correct item (Conrad 1964), while sequences of phonologically similar items are hard to recall accurately (Baddeley 1966a).

When the task required long-term learning, however, the pattern was quite different, with coding based on meaning becoming important and phonological similarity ceasing to significant factor (Baddeley 1966b; Kintsch & Buschke 1969; Sachs 1967).

早在 1883 年，Francis Galton 就提出了可能存在两种不同类型记忆的想法，但是关于长期记忆与短期记忆之间的功能性分离的争论，真正因为 Broadbent 在 1958 年的研究而变得突出。Broadbent 强烈支持这种二元划分，而 Melton 在 1963 年提出的反对观点则倾向于认为记忆是一个统一的概念。这引发了对这一分离理论的实证证据的探索。尽管这一主题的文献已经有所回顾（例如，由 Baddeley 在 1976 年），但以下几个方面的证据支持长短期记忆分离的观点：

1、双成分任务。研究显示，某些任务包含了两个记忆成分：一个相对稳定的长期记忆成分和一个更加易变的短期记忆成分（例如，Glanzer 1972 年的研究；Peterson 1966 年的研究；Waugh 和 Norman 1965 年的研究）。

2、神经心理学证据。早在 1940 年代，就已知患有科萨科夫综合症的患者展现出长期学习能力的显著障碍，但他们在重复一串数字或单词的能力 —— 一种测量记忆跨度的方式 —— 却可能保持正常（Zangwill, 1946）。Milner 在 1966 年指出，经典的失忆症患者 H.M. 显示出即时记忆与长期记忆之间的明显区分。而 Baddeley 与 Warrington 在 1970 年的研究则通过检验失忆症患者在被认为反映短期与长期记忆成分的任务上的表现，支持了这种记忆二分的观点。

进一步的神经学分离证据由 Shallice 和 Warrington 在 1970 年提出，他们描述了一个具有正常长期学习能力但即时记忆跨度仅有两项的患者。

3、不同的编码方式。即时记忆任务的证据显示，短期记忆在很大程度上依赖于某种语言编码，即代表材料的声音或口头特征，而非其含义。错误往往在语音上与正确项相似（Conrad, 1964），而语音相似的项序列难以准确回忆（Baddeley, 1966a）。

然而，当任务涉及到长期学习时，情况则大为不同，以含义为基础的编码变得重要，语音相似性不再是一个重要因素（Baddeley, 1966b；Kintsch 与 Buschke, 1969；Sachs, 1967）。

1『记忆一分为二理论（长期记忆和短期记忆），是 Broadbent 于 1958 年提出的。重点来了，短期记忆和长期记忆的编码原理不同。短期记忆的编码更侧重于 speech（语言），而长期记忆的编码更侧重于 meaning（意义）。』

### 03. The Modal Model

By the late 1960s, this and other sources of evidence seemed to point clearly to a dichotomy between long-term and short-term memory. A great many competing models of short-term memory were developed, often expressed mathematically and attempting to make precise predictions, although typically of a very limited set of experimental data. 

The models tended to have much in common, and could be regarded as variants on a single underlying theme, which Murdock termed the "modal model". The most influential of these was that presented by Atkinson & Shiffrin  (1968). This was essentially a development of Broadbent's original model (Broadbent 1958), and, like it, distinguished two kinds of short-term system: a range of briefsensory stores capable of operating in parallel, which in turn feed into a unitary short-term memory store of limited capacity. The latter was assumed to function as a working memory needed for holding and manipulating information and for transferring it to the more permanent long-term memory system. Transfer was assumed to be automatic but relatively slow. 

Consequently, learning required maintaining information in short-term memory. The longer the maintenance the greater the degree of transfer and the greater the amount of learning. The short-term store was assumed to have access to a number of control processes or strategies for manipulating information, Although a range of such processes was postulated, empirical investigation was largely confined to the simple process of subvocal rote rehearsal.

到了 20 世纪 60 年代末，众多的证据开始明确支持长期记忆与短期记忆之间存在明显的区别。随之而来，学界提出了众多关于短期记忆的模型，这些模型尝试用数学方法来描述并精确预测记忆的工作方式，尽管它们大多只涉及有限的实验数据。

这些模型之间有许多相似之处，它们可以看作是围绕一个核心概念 ——Murdock 所称的「模式模型」—— 的各种变体。在这些模型中，Atkinson 和 Shiffrin 在 1968 年提出的模型尤为重要。这个模型实际上是对 Broadbent 在 1958 年提出的原始模型的扩展，同样区分了两类短期记忆系统：一种是能够并行工作的短暂感觉存储系统，它们将信息传递给一个容量有限的统一短期记忆存储。这个短期记忆存储被认为是一种工作记忆，用于保持和处理信息，以及将信息转移到更为持久的长期记忆系统中。这种转移过程被认为是自动进行的，但相对较慢。

因此，学习过程需要将信息保持在短期记忆中。信息保持的时间越长，其转移到长期记忆中的程度就越大，学习的效果也越好。短期记忆被认为可以使用多种控制过程或策略来处理信息，虽然提出了多种这样的处理过程，但实际的研究主要集中在默念式的机械记忆重复这一简单过程上。

### 04. Problems with the Modal Model

In the early I970s, the amount of work on short-term memory began to decline; the reasons for this decline are various, but probably included the growing complexity of empirical data in the field: new techniques had begun to proliferate, and the problems of mapping the results of any technique onto a single underlying theoretical structure became progressively more complex. At the same time it became increasingly clear that certain phenomena were difficult to fit into the modal model. These included the following:

1. Neuropsychological evidence. If short-term memory is necessary for long-term learning, then why should patients such as those studied by Shallice& Warrington (1970), whose short-term learning ability is clearly impaired, show normal long-term memory.

2. Dissociation between short-term memory and long-term learning. A number of studies observed that repeated rote rehearsal may lead to very poor long-term retention unless some form of leeper semantic processing or elaboration takes place. The most influential experimental demonstration of this was offered by Craik &atkins (1973), but a more expensive though inadvertent demonstration was provided by the B.B.C, who attempted to use saturation advertising to familiarize its audience with a change in radio wavelengths. Bekerian & Baddeley  (1980) investigated the effectiveness of this campaign, which involved presenting the information in repeated announcements, statements and jingles on radio programmes over a period of weeks. We were able to estimate that subjects must have heard the information in excess of 1000 times and yet retained virtually none of it, confirming the observation of Craik & Watkins that repetition does not guarantee learning.

3. Long-term recency effects. The recency effect in free recall is probably the most characteristic example of a short-term component of a two-component task. The suggestion that the recency effect reflects the contents of a short-term store ran into difficulties, however, with the discovery of recency effects extending over long periods of time. These range from several minutes under laboratory conditions  (see, for example, Tzeng 1973) to days or even weeks in rugby players asked to remember which teams they had played against (Baddeley & Hitch 1977). 

Other evidence against the necessary association of recency with short-term memory is reviewed by Baddeley &Hitch (1976) and by Watkins Peynircioglu (1983). Recency has so far been investigated primarily as a limited laboratory phenomenon, of theoretical but not practical significance. I myself suspect that recency represents a very basic and important aspect of human memory concerned with the vital question of maintaining orientation in time and space. However, although it seems a simple phenomenon, we still do not have a good general model of recency, or indeed an adequate understanding of the similarities and differences between long-term and short-term recency effects.

在 1970 年代初，短期记忆的研究开始减少。这种趋势的原因多种多样，主要包括实验数据越来越复杂和新技术的广泛应用，这使得将实验结果融合进一个统一的理论框架变得越来越困难。同时，越来越多的现象难以被纳入传统的模式模型之中。这些现象包括：

1、神经心理学证据。如果短期记忆对长期学习是必需的，那么为什么那些短期学习能力明显受损，但长期记忆却正常的患者（如 Shallice& Warrington 1970 年的研究对象）存在？

2、短期记忆与长期学习之间的区别。一系列研究表明，除非伴有某种深入的语义处理或扩展，否则单纯的重复记忆往往无法实现长期保持。Craik & Watkins（1973）通过实验明确展示了这一点。BBC 通过大量广告试图让听众熟悉无线电频率的变化，这次无意中的演示尽管成本高昂，却证实了重复并不等同于学习。Bekerian & Baddeley（1980）的研究发现，尽管受试者可能听到这条信息超过 1000 次，但几乎没有任何保留。

3、长期近因效应。自由回忆中的近因效应是双组分任务中短期成分的一个典型例子。然而，随着长时间跨度的近因效应被发现，这一假设遇到了挑战。这种效应可以从实验室条件下的几分钟延伸到橄榄球运动员被要求回忆几天甚至几周前比赛对手的情况。

Baddeley & Hitch（1976）和 Watkins Peynircioglu（1983）提出了反对短期记忆必然与近因效应关联的其他证据。到目前为止，近因效应主要被看作是一个理论上而非实践上重要的有限实验室现象。我个人认为，近因效应反映了人类记忆中一个基本且重要的方面 —— 关于如何在时间和空间中保持定向的问题。然而，尽管它似乎是一个简单的现象，我们对于近因效应还没有一个好的通用模型，甚至对于长期和短期近因效应之间的相似性和差异也缺乏足够的理解。

### 05. Alternatives to the Modal Model

#### 5.1 Levels of Processing

As the modal model began to lose favour, it was succeeded in popularity by a theoretical framework presented by Craik &Lockhart (1972), who termed their approach Levels of processing. This approach changes the emphasis of the modal model away from structure to processing, and postulates that the more deeply a subject processes a stimulus, the more durable will its memory trace be. However, although the concept of levels of processing offers a useful rule of thumb for predicting the effects of differential coding in long-term memory, it is open to a number of theoretical criticisms (Baddeley I978), and has said little about the nature of working memory; hence it will not be further discussed here.

随着模式模型逐渐不受青睐，Craik & Lockhart（1972 年）提出的一种理论框架逐步走红，他们称之为「处理层次」。这个理论框架的重心从模式模型的结构转向了信息处理过程，并提出了这样一个观点：主体对信息进行的处理越深入，相应的记忆痕迹就越持久。然而，虽然「处理层次」理论为预测长期记忆中不同编码方式的效果提供了实用的经验法则，但它也受到了许多理论批评（Baddeley，1978），并且几乎没有对工作记忆的本质做出解释；因此，我们不在此展开讨论。

#### 5.2 Working Memory

Although it had been widely assumed that short-term memory functioned as a temporary working memory, until recently empirical evidence for such a view was remarkably sparse Indeed, patients such as those who appeared to have grossly defective short-term memory, Studied by Shallice Warrington, often seemed to encounter very few practical problems in coping with the information-processing demands of their everyday life. In the early 1970s Hitch & I decided that we would explore this point further by attempting to disrupt the operation of short-term memory in normal subjects, and then observing their performance on a range of information-processing tasks.

FIGURE 1. Speed and accuracy of verbal reasoning as a function of concurrent memory load.

What Murdock called the modal model made two primary assumptions: first, that the system had limited storage capacity, and second, that the digit span task taxed this limited capacity to the full. We therefore presented our subjects with sequences of digits that they were required to maintain by rehearsing aloud while they attempted to perform one of a number of other tasks. These were tasks that might be expected to depend on a limited-capacity working memory, and included learning, comprehension of prose, and verbal reasoning.

One such experiment (Baddeley &Lewis, unpublished), involved requiring our subjects to remember sequences of from one to eight random numbers while performing a reasoning task in which they were to decide whether sentences correctly described the order of two letters. Some sentences were simple such as A follows B-BA:  (true), while others were made more complex by including passives and negatives  (B is not preceded by A-BA: true). Our results are shown in figure 1.

As predicted by the working memory hypothesis, reasoning takes longer as the memory load increases. Note, however, first that the effect on latency is clear but not massive, and secondly that accuracy remains at approximately 95 regardless of memory load. Finally individual subjects varied widely, with some showing virtually no effect until the load reached seven or

eight digits. Memory load does interfere, implying some overlap of processing with the reasoning task, but even loading the subjects' memory to capacity still leaves them able to reason accurately.

Comparable results were obtained from studies of learning and of comprehension, and together with the evidence against the simple modal model described earlier convinced us of the need to abandon the assumption of a single unitary short-term memory in favour of a working memory that comprises a central controller together with a number of interrelated subsystems  (Baddeley Hitch 1974). I shall begin by outlining the system briefly before discussing two of the subsystems in more detail. It should perhaps be pointed out that what follows represents my current view of a changing and developing model. As such it differs in some ways from earlier formulations, and will itself be superseded as more is learnt about working memory.

虽然人们普遍认为短期记忆充当着临时工作记忆的角色，但直到不久前，支撑这种看法的直接证据还相当少。比如，Shallice Warrington 研究的那些短期记忆明显受损的患者，日常生活中处理信息的需求似乎并没有给他们带来太多实际问题。在 1970 年代初期，Hitch & I 和我决定进一步研究这个问题，我们尝试通过干预正常人的短期记忆机制，然后观察他们在各种信息处理任务上的表现。

图 1. 语言推理速度和准确度随记忆负荷变化的关系图。

Murdock 定义的模式模型基于两个关键假设：一是这个系统的存储容量是有限的；二是数字记忆跨度测试会充分挑战这一有限的容量。因此，我们让受试者在执行一系列可能依赖于有限容量工作记忆的任务（如学习、理解文章和语言推理）时，尝试保持一串数字，通过大声复述这些数字来实现。

在一项实验中（Baddeley & Lewis，尚未发表），我们要求参与者记住一串包含 1 到 8 个随机数字的序列，同时执行一个判断任务，他们需要决定给定的句子是否正确描述了两个字母的顺序。一些句子非常简单，例如「A 在 B 之后 - BA：（真）」，而其他一些句子则通过使用被动语态和否定语态来增加复杂性（「B 不是由 A 先行 - BA：真」）。我们的研究结果展示在图 1 中。

正如工作记忆假说所预期的那样，随着记忆负担的增加，进行推理的时间也会相应增长。但是，需要注意的是，首先，这种延时的效果虽然明显，但并不巨大；其次，不论记忆负荷如何，准确率大约保持在 95%。最后，参与者间的差异很大，有些人直到记忆负荷达到七或八位数字时才显示出明显的影响。记忆负荷确实会造成一定的干扰，这表明它与推理任务在处理上有所重叠，但即便是将参与者的记忆负荷推至极限，他们仍能保持准确的推理能力。

通过对学习和理解能力的研究，我们获得了相似的结果，这些结果连同之前提到的反对简单模态模型的证据，促使我们认为有必要抛弃单一的短期记忆模型，转而支持一个由中心控制器及多个相互关联的子系统组成的工作记忆体系（Baddeley & Hitch，1974 年）。我将先对这个系统做一个简要的介绍，然后更详细地探讨其中的两个子系统。值得一提的是，接下来的内容代表了我对这个不断变化和发展中的模型的当前理解。因此，它在一些方面与之前的论述有所不同，随着我们对工作记忆的进一步了解，这些理解也将不断更新。

### 06. The Central Executive

A simplified representation of the working memory system is presented in figure 2. This shows two of the major subcomponents of the system, together with the central executive-the core of the system that is responsible for coordinating information from the subsidiary slave systems The central executive is assumed to function like a limited-capacity attentional system capable of selecting and operating control processes and strategies. It represents the most complex aspect of working memory and the most difficult both to analyse and conceptualize. Consequently we have concentrated on the presumably simpler task of splitting off and studying the more peripheral slave systems, gradually whittling down the functions that we need to assign to the central processor. In this respect, the central executive could, not unfairly, be described as the area of residual ignorance. It is indeed possible that it may ultimately prove unnecessary to assume a central executive if, as for example Barnard  (1983) suggests, control is exercised by he interaction of the various subsystems without recourse to a central controller. At present however, I can see no way of achieving this, and consequently find it useful to retain the concept of a central executive if only as a reminder of the important question of how the whole working memory system is controlled.

FIGURE 2. A simplified representation of the working memory model.

图 2 展示了工作记忆模型的简化图示。

图 2 提供了工作记忆系统的一个简化图示。图中展示了系统的两个主要部分及中央执行系统 —— 这个系统的核心部分负责协调从辅助子系统中来的信息。中央执行系统被视为一种有限容量的注意力系统，它能够挑选和实施控制流程及策略。这部分代表了工作记忆中最为复杂的领域，也是分析和定义最为困难的部分。因此，我们主要关注于相对简单的任务 —— 区分和研究边缘的子系统，逐步减少我们认为需要由中心处理器承担的功能。从这个角度看，中央执行系统可以被视为我们知识的空白区域。实际上，如果像 Barnard（1983 年）所建议的那样，各个子系统之间的相互作用能够自行执行控制功能，而无需一个中央控制器，那么最终我们可能不需要假设有一个中央执行系统。但是，目前来看，我还没有找到达到这一目的的方法，因此，我认为保留中央执行系统的概念还是有用的，至少它提醒我们一个重要的问题：整个工作记忆系统是如何被控制的。

### 07. Passive and Active Storage Process

It is assumed that the central executive can take advantage of a number of more peripheral storage systems. Such stores are probably multi-functional, also playing parts in other processes such as perception and speech processing, I suggest that we should distinguish between passive stores, in which information is registered and subsequently either fades or is displaced, on the one hand, and active stores on the other. It is suggested that active storage involves rehearsal, a process whereby the system reads out information from the store and then feeds it back thereby continually refreshing or updating the memory trace. This is best illustrated describing the two active slave systems hat we have so far investigated in most detail: the articulatory loop (a 1) and the visuo-spatial scratch-pad  (v s. S. P.).

被动与主动的存储机制

中央执行系统能够利用一系列更为边缘的存储系统。这些存储系统往往具有多种功能，在感知、语言处理等其他过程中也有所作用。我认为，我们应当区分被动存储和主动存储两种形式：在被动存储中，信息被登记后可能会逐渐消失或被新信息取代；而在主动存储中，则涉及到一种复述过程，即系统不断地从存储中提取信息并重新输入，以此方式持续刷新或更新记忆痕迹。这一点可以通过我们到目前为止研究得最为透彻的两个主动辅助系统 —— 语音回路（articulatory loop）和视觉-空间草稿本（visuo-spatial scratch-pad）—— 来更好地说明。

#### 7.1 The Articulatory Loop

One of the most striking features of earlier work on short-term memory was the association with speech coding. Indeed, this led to suggestions that short-term memory was synonymous with a subvocal rehearsal system. The working memory concept, on the other hand, restricts phonological coding to one of the subsidiary slave systems, the articulatory loop. The loop is assumed to comprise two components, a phonological input store and an articulatory rehearsal process involving subvocal speech. This relatively simple model is able to account for a large amount of empirical data, including the following:

(a) The phonological similarity effect. Sequences of consonants with similar sounding names such as b, g, C, w, 4, p are harder to remember than dissimilar sets such as h, w, y, k, r, / (Conrad Hull 1964).

(b) The word length effect. Memory span decreases with increased word length, and hence the span for monosyllables such as sum, day, wit, harm, peg, is substantially larger than that for polysyllables such as university, aluminium, representative, opportunity, organizaton Further, the span is a simple function of spoken duration rather than number of syllables, thus words that can be said quickly such as bishop and wicket are remembered better than words such as harpoon and Friday. When a subjects span is measured in terms of spoken duration, it works out at approximately 1. 5 s, regardless of the lengths of the words (Baddeley et al. 1975b)  

(c) The unattended speech effect. Memory for visually presented items such as numbers can be impaired by the simultaneous presentation of spoken material that the subject is instructed to ignore. The semantic characteristics of the unattended material are unimportant, with nonsense syllables being as disruptive as words, whereas phonological factors are of significance, with bursts of noise having a much smaller effect than unattended speech (Salame& Baddeley 1982)  

(d) The articulatory suppression efect. When subvocal rehearsal is prevented by requiring the subject to articulate continually some irrelevant sound such as the word the, performance on immediate memory span is consistently impaired. Suppression has the further effect of Teracting with the three previous phonological variables. The unattended speech effect disappears, the word length effect becomes insignificantly small, and the phonological similarity effect is abolished when presentation is visual, but not when it is auditory.

早期短期记忆研究的一个显著特点是它与语言编码的紧密联系。这种观点进一步演变为，短期记忆可能就是一个在我们心中默念的系统。然而，「工作记忆」这一概念提出了新的看法，它将语音编码仅限于一个辅助的系统内 —— 我们可以将之想象为一个内部的语音循环器。这个循环包括两个部分：一个是捕捉我们听到的语音的「存储库」，另一个则是我们在心中重复语言的过程，就像是在默默地对自己说话。这个比较简单的模型帮助我们解释了很多实验发现，包括：

(a) 相似声音的困扰。比如，b、g、C、w、4、p 这样发音相近的字母组合比 h、w、y、k、r 这样的不相似组合更难以记忆。这说明我们在处理和记忆信息时，很大程度上依赖于声音的区分。

(b) 单词长度的影响。简短的单词比长单词更容易记忆。例如，「sum」、「day」这样的单音节词比「university」、「aluminium」这样的多音节词记忆效果要好。有趣的是，这种记忆效果更多地与单词说出来的时间有关，而不是单词的音节数量。快速说出的单词，如「bishop」和「wicket」，比「harpoon」和「Friday」这样的单词更容易被记住。研究发现，不管单词长短，我们记住的信息量大约在 1.5 秒钟的语言长度。

(c) 忽略背景言语的挑战。当我们尝试记住视觉呈现的内容（比如数字）时，如果背景有说话声，即使我们试图忽略它，也会干扰我们的记忆。这种干扰与背景言语的意义无关，哪怕是毫无意义的音节也一样。但是，与纯粹的噪音相比，言语的干扰效果更大。

(d) 内部默读的抑制。当我们被要求不断重复一些无关的词汇，如「the」，以此来阻断内部默读时，我们的记忆能力会明显下降。这种抑制还影响到了其他几个与声音相关的记忆现象。例如，当我们无法在心中重复时，对背景言语的忽略变得更容易，单词长度的影响减少，而且当信息是通过视觉呈现时，相似声音的干扰效果也会消失，但听觉呈现的情况则不受影响。

这些发现帮助我们更好地理解了工作记忆的复杂性以及语音在记忆过程中的关键作用。

The articulatory loop model accounts for these results as follows. It is assumed that the phonological store can be accessed either by subvocal speech, an optional strategy, or directly through auditory speech input, an obligatory process. Phonologically similar items are assumed to lay down similar and hence confusable traces in this store. With auditory presentation, registration in the store is obligatory regardless of whether the subject is engaged in subvocal rehearsal. With visual presentation, such registration occurs only if the subject is able to subvocalize the items as they are presented. If this is prevented by articulatory suppression, then the material is not registered in the phonological store, recall is based on other sources of stored information  (possibly visual), and no phonological similarity effect occurs. 

The word length effect is assumed to be a characteristic not of the phonological store but of the articulatory rehearsal process. Memory span is a function of both the durability of a trace within the phonological store and the rate at which rehearsal can refresh that trace. If unrehearsed, a phonological trace will fade within 1-2 s. Rehearsal reactivates the trace, and consequently if rehearsal can be repeated every 1-2 s, forgetting will be prevented. Memory span is determined by the number of items that can be rehearsed and hence reactivated before the traces fade. Long-duration words take longer to rehearse, and so the number that can be maintained in the 1-2s available is less than for short words. Articulatory suppression pre rehearsal and hence removes the effect of word length.

The effect of unattended speech is assumed to occur because spoken material has obligatory access to the phonological store. Under normal conditions, visually presented items will be recoded phonologically so as to take advantage of this supplementary storage. If, however, the store is corrupted by irrelevant speech, this advantage is minimized. With articulatory suppression, the subvocal transfer of information to the phonological store is not possible, and any disruption of that store by unattended speech has no influence on performance.

语音回路模型对这些现象的解释基于以下假设：我们有一个专门的「语音存储区」，它可以通过两种方式获取信息：一种是我们在心里默读时使用的方式，另一种则是通过我们的耳朵直接听到的言语。当我们处理相似的声音时，它们在这个存储区留下的印记很相似，因此很容易弄混。

对于通过听觉接收的信息，不管我们是否在心中重复，这些信息都会被自动存入我们的语音存储区。但如果是通过视觉接收的信息，比如阅读，只有在我们能够在心里「读出来」这些信息时，它们才会被存储。如果我们被阻止进行这样的内部重复（比如同时进行一项要求我们不停说话的任务），这些视觉信息就不会以语音形式被存储，我们可能就会依赖其他类型的记忆（比如视觉记忆），这时就不会出现因声音相似而混淆的情况。

至于单词长度对记忆的影响，并不是存储本身的特点，而是重复这个过程的特点。我们记住信息的能力，取决于信息在语音存储区保持的时间以及我们重复这个信息刷新记忆的速度。如果不进行重复，信息很快就会消失。通过重复，我们可以让这些信息保持活跃，从而避免遗忘。因此，记忆的范围取决于在信息消失前我们能重复并重新激活多少信息。长单词需要更多时间来重复，因此在有限的时间里，我们能够维持的信息就比短单词少。当我们进行言语抑制，也就是被禁止内部重复时，单词的长度就不再影响记忆了。

未注意言语的影响被认为是因为口头材料自动进入语音存储。通常情况下，即使是视觉呈现的项目，我们也会尝试将其转换成语音形式来存储，以此利用额外的存储空间。然而，如果这个存储空间被无关的言语干扰了，这种优势就会减少。而当进行言语抑制时，我们就无法将信息以语音形式转移至存储区，任何对存储区的干扰也就不会影响到我们的记忆表现了。

这种模型的解释帮助我们理解了为什么在不同的情况下我们的记忆能力会有所不同，以及我们如何通过内部重复来增强记忆力。

The articulatory loop therefore appears to be essentially an input store whose primary function is probable speech perception, which can be transformed at the users option into an active memory store by means of subvocal rehearsal. It is clear that such rehearsal need not be overtly vocal, but it is less clear to what extent rehearsal requires peripheral articulation as opposed to the running off of more central articulatory programs. An opportunity to Ivestigate this question occurred recently in a study done jointly with Barbara Wilson of the Rivermead Rehabilitation Centre Oxford, of a patient who had lost the power of overt speech as a result of brain damage.

The patient was an undergraduate who had been involved in a car crash that left him, initially, completely paralysed. He subsequently recovered the use of his upper limbs but remained totally unable to speak, his vocalization being limited to an inarticulate inspiratory cry. However, using a Canon communicator he was able to converse by typing out his responses He was non-aphasic as determined by the Token Test, which requires performing complex instructions, and showed excellent comprehension on both vocabulary and synonym-matching tests.

We explored his immediate memory performance in some detail, being concerned especially with the question of whether he would show any evidence of a functioning articulatory loop Should the loop be dependent on peripheral articulation, then the patient should perform much as would a normal subject under articulatory suppression. On the other hand, if subvocal rehearsal can be performed entirely centrally, one might expect relatively normal performance. Our results, shown in table 1, indicate first that his memory span is relatively normal, secondly that he shows a phonological similarity effect not only with auditory, but also with visual presentation. Finally, he shows a clear word-length effect, suggesting that some form ofsubvocal rehearsal is occurring, and that as with normal articulatory rehearsal, it is slower for longer than for shorter words. Thus the process of subvocal rehearsal appears to be independent of the control of the peripheral articulatory musculature. Broadly comparable results have been obtained by Nebes  (1975) and in unpublished work from Milan  (G. Vallar, personal communication).

语音回路模型实质上是一个处理语音感知的存储系统，通过在心中默读，我们可以将它变为一个活跃的记忆工具。虽然这种重复过程不必要通过真正的发声来完成，但我们还不确定这个过程到底需不需要真正动用我们的发音器官，或者它是否可以仅仅在大脑内部完成。

在一项与牛津 Rivermead 康复中心的 Barbara Wilson 合作的研究中，我们有机会深入探讨了这个问题，研究对象是一位因脑损伤而失去了发言能力的患者。

这位患者原是一名学生，一场车祸使他初期完全瘫痪。虽然后来他的上肢恢复了一些功能，但他依然失去了说话的能力，只能发出简单的吸气声。不过，他通过使用 Canon 通讯器来打字交流，显示出了良好的语言理解能力，包括通过 Token 测试证明他没有失语症，以及在词汇和同义词测试上的优异表现。

我们详细考察了他的即时记忆能力，特别是想了解他是否还能使用语音回路。如果这种回路必须要靠发音器官来完成，那么他的记忆能力应该与正常人在被禁止发声时的情况相似。但如果这个过程可以完全在大脑内部完成，那么他的表现应该比较正常。我们的研究结果显示，他的记忆范围接近正常，而且不仅在听觉呈现，甚至在视觉呈现时也展现了因声音相似而困扰的现象。此外，他还表现出了单词长度效应，说明他在进行某种形式的内心默读，而且像正常人一样，处理较长单词的速度比较短的单词慢。因此，这表明内心默读过程不依赖于我们的发音肌肉的控制。其他研究，如 Nebes 在 1975 年的研究和米兰的未发表研究（G. Vallar 个人交流）也得出了相似的结论。

这些发现揭示了我们大脑处理和存储信息的复杂机制，即使在失去了外部发音能力的情况下，我们的记忆系统依旧能够通过内部的方式来有效地工作。

Although the pattern of results from the various studies described is consistent with our simple model of the articulatory loop, a number of puzzles remain. One of these is that although articulatory suppression appears to prevent phonological coding, as indicated by the phono-logical similarity effect, it does not hamper a subjects ability to judge whether two written words rhyme or not (Baddeley Lewis 1981). It is very easy to demonstrate a similar effect simply by reading and suppressing articulation. Most people find that they can"hear'an inner voice despite the suppression. Why this inner voice is not sufficient to sustain rehearsal. Or to show phonemic similarity effects, remains a puzzle. Does it represent an auditory image, and if so how is this related to the functioning of the articulatory loop?

A second puzzle concerns the nature of the system in which visually presented material is stored during articulatory suppression. The systems insensitivity to phonological similarity implies that the code is not phonemic in nature. However, the system does appear able to retain order information, whereas the function of the visuo-spatial scratch-pad described below seems To be in maintaining a single spatially organized representation On the other hand the difficult in obtaining clear effects of visual similarity in memory for letters makes a simple peripheral visual store seem unlikely, and suggests something rather more abstract or possibly lexical. It seems likely that the nature of the"inner voice' and the characteristics of this"visual' store will receive increasing attention over the next few years.

虽然各项研究的发现与我们对语音回路的简易模型相吻合，但仍有一些未解之谜。比如，尽管看起来言语抑制会阻断我们通过声音进行记忆的能力，正如那些发音相近的词更难记住所显示的那样，但这种抑制却不影响我们判断两个词是否押韵的能力（Baddeley Lewis 1981）。实际上，通过简单地阅读并抑制内部发音，我们就能感受到类似的现象。大多数人会发现，即便进行了抑制，他们依然能够「听见」心中的声音。为何这种内心的声音不能支持重复练习或展示出音位的相似效应，这仍是一个谜。这是否意味着我们心中的这个声音是一种听觉影像？如果是的话，它又是如何与语音回路的工作联系起来的呢？

另一个谜团是，在我们通过言语抑制时，视觉呈现的信息是如何被存储的。这种存储系统对于发音相似性的不敏感表明，它并非以音位的形式存在。然而，这个系统似乎能够保留信息的顺序，这与我们下文将讲到的，专门负责维护空间组织信息的视觉-空间记事本功能不同。而且，很难清楚地看到视觉相似性对字母记忆影响的实验效果，这让人怀疑是否存在某种简单的视觉存储系统，而更可能指向某种更抽象或可能是词汇相关的存储方式。看来，「内心声音」和这种「视觉」存储的本质及其特点，在未来几年将会成为研究的热点。

这些探讨指出，我们对于如何在大脑中存储和处理视觉和听觉信息的理解还有很长的路要走。这些谜团不仅挑战着我们现有的模型，也为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

#### 7.2 The visuo-spatial scratch-pad

This is the second system that we have explored in some detail. It appears to be specialized for maintaining and manipulating visuo-spatial images, and to resemble the articulatory loop in being essentially an input store with active storage capabilities attributable to the regeneration of memory traces by a process external to the store.

The functioning of the v s. S. P. Is perhaps best illustrated by using a technique initially devised by Brooks (1967) to separate verbal and visual short-term memory. This is illustrated in figure 3 which comprises a matrix of cells, one of which is denoted the starting square. The subjects task is to repeat back a series of statements. In one condition the statements can be recoded into a path through the matrix, and hence remembered as a particular pattern. The pattern can then be recoded back into the original statements for recall. The non-spatial comparison condition is formally equivalent except that the adjectives presented are not suitable for simple spatial encoding, and at the rate at which material is typically presented subjects are forced to remember the sequence by rote. Examples of the two types of sequence are given below the matrix in figure 3. Recalling eight spatially coded statements is about as difficult as recalling six of the non-spatial nonsense sequences. Work by Brooks indicates that the spatial sequences are best retained when presented auditorily, while the nonsense sequences are best retained when presented visually. His interpretation is that representation of the spatial sequences relies on a visuo-spatial coding system that mutually interferes with visual processing of written material, while the nonsense material does not.

这是我们已经较为深入研究的第二个系统。它似乎专为保持和操控视觉空间图像而设计，并且它与语音回路相似，本质上是一个具备主动存储能力的输入存储系统，这种能力是通过外部过程对记忆痕迹进行再生来实现的。

视觉空间画板（Visuo-Spatial Scratch Pad，VSSP）的运作机制，可以通过一种最初由 Brooks（1967 年）发明的技术来演示，该技术旨在区分言语与视觉的短期记忆。如图 3 所示，这涉及到一个单元格矩阵，矩阵中有一个单元格被标记为起始方格。参与者的任务是回顾一系列语句。在某种条件下，这些语句可以被重新编码为穿越矩阵的路径，因此被记作一个特定的图案。然后，这个图案可以被重新编码回原始语句以供回忆。与之形式上等同的非空间对比条件则是，提供的形容词不适合简单的空间编码，且在通常的材料展示速度下，参与者必须依靠死记硬背来记住序列。图 3 下方给出了两种类型序列的示例。回想八个经空间编码的语句与回想六个非空间的无意义序列的难度相当。Brooks 的研究显示，空间序列在通过听觉呈现时记忆效果最好，而无意义序列在通过视觉呈现时记忆效果最好。他认为，空间序列的呈现依赖于一个视觉空间编码系统，该系统与书面材料的视觉处理相互干扰，而无意义材料则不会造成这种干扰。

Experiments of our own began by exploring an observation made while trying to perform a natural visual imagery task, listening to an American football game on the radio while performing the visuo-spatial task of steering a car down an American freeway. The two tasks seemed to interact, and I hurriedly switched the radio to a music programme. In our laboratory studies we used Brook's task to induce imagery and as an analogue of the driving task, used e traditional psychological apparatus known as the pursuit rotor, in which the subject attempts to keep a stylus in contact with a spot following a circular track. Using this approach we made the following observations.

1. Tracking caused marked impairment in performance on the spatial memory task, but had no effect on the nonsense task involving rote verbal memory (Baddeley et al. 1975a, expt 2).

2. When the memory tasks were given priority, the spatial task disrupted tracking much more than did the verbal task  (Baddeley et al. 1975a, expt 1).

3. We carried out an experiment to investigate whether the system was primarily visual or more generally spatial in character by studying the effect on the two Brooks's tasks of a visual but non-spatial secondary task  (judging the brightness of a patch of light) and a spatial but non-visual task  (tracking the location of a moving sound source while blindfolded, using a flashlight). When the flashlight was on target, the sound changed, providing feedback Although this task was spatial, because the subject was blindfolded it did not involve the peripheral visual system. Our results showed that imagery was much more disrupted by this latter task than by the visual brightness judgement, which tended to have a greater effect on the nonsense memory task. This and other data from other investigators suggest that the system is primarily spatial rather than visual in nature (Baddeley Lieberman 1980).

4. A series of experiments explored the role of imagery in memory for words, using the concurrent tracking task as a source of disruption. Results suggested that spatial imagery mnemonics such as the classic location mnemonics rely on the v. S. S. P. And are disrupted by concurrent tracking. On the other hand, the general tendency for words of high imageability to be better remembered than abstract words is unaffected by concurrent spatial tracking, suggesting that this effect may reflect the manner in which such words are registered in semantic memory, rather than the active strategy of the subject (Baddeley et al. 1975a; Baddeley Lieberman 1980).

我们自己的实验起始于一个实际观察：在试图完成一个自然的视觉想象任务时 —— 即边听美式足球赛的广播边驾驶汽车在美国高速公路上行驶 —— 发现这两项任务似乎产生了相互干扰，因此我赶紧切换到音乐节目。在实验室研究中，我们采用了 Brooks 的任务来引发想象力，并用一种传统的心理学设备 —— 追踪转子作为驾驶任务的类比，实验参与者要努力使一支笔尖跟随一个圆形轨迹上的点保持接触。通过这种方式，我们做了以下几点观察：

1、追踪任务显著降低了空间记忆任务的表现，但对于依赖于机械记忆的无意义言语任务却没有影响（Baddeley 等人，1975a，实验 2）。

2、当给予记忆任务优先权时，空间任务对追踪的干扰远超过言语任务（Baddeley 等人，1975a，实验 1）。

3、我们进行了一项实验，通过研究一个视觉但非空间的次要任务（评判一块光斑的亮度）和一个空间但非视觉的任务（在被蒙上眼睛的情况下，通过手电筒追踪一个移动声源的位置）对两个 Brooks 任务的影响，来探究这个系统是主要基于视觉还是更广泛地基于空间特性。结果表明，相比于视觉亮度判断，空间任务更能显著干扰想象力，而后者则更倾向于影响无意义记忆任务。这一结果及其他研究者的数据表明，该系统主要是基于空间而非视觉（Baddeley Lieberman 1980）。

4、我们通过使用同时进行的追踪任务作为干扰源来探索想象力在单词记忆中的作用。结果显示，像经典的位置记忆法这样基于空间想象的助记法依赖于视觉空间画板（VSSP），并且会被同时进行的追踪所干扰。另一方面，高可想象性词汇比抽象词汇记忆得更好的普遍现象，不会受到同时空间追踪的影响，这表明这种效果可能反映了这些词汇在语义记忆中的注册方式，而非参与者的主动策略（Baddeley 等人，1975a；Baddeley Lieberman 1980）。

It was suggested that the articulatory loop system is an active one, capable of maintaining information because it combines a passive phonological store with active articulation that permits internal input to the store and hence refreshment of the memory trace. Given that the visuo-spatial scratch-pad also appears to function as an active store in which information can be maintained, the question arises as to the nature of the process responsible for maintaining the trace. One suggestion that has frequently been made is that eye movements are involved in setting up, maintaining or retrieving visuo-spatial images (see, for example Hebb 1968). On he whole, however, evidence for this view is sparse, coming mainly from attempts to monitor eye movements while subjects are instructed to form visual images, and typically producing weak or conflicting results (see, for example, Brown 1968; Hiscock &Bergstrom 1981). This approach would be analogous to studying the articulatory loop by using electrodes to monitor the articulatory muscles. Such a technique has indeed been used to study subvocal speech producing effects of varied magnitude and reliability, and revealing little about the underlying processes. Since our subject who has no control over his articulatory muscles nevertheless appears to have perfectly adequate inner speech, it seems unlikely that monitoring the activity of the speech musculature will give a very adequate indication of the articulatory loop.

A more fruitful technique in studying the articulatory loop is suppression. Is it possible, then, that eye movements might suppress spatial coding? Unpublished work by Nancy V. Vanderbilt University provided some evidence that optical nystagmus might disrupt the use of visual imagery, and so we decided to explore the effect on the Brooks imagery task of seating our subjects in a revolving chair and rotating them vigorously (Idzikowski et al. 1983). The results of this somewhat draconian procedure were rather disappointing. Although clear post-rotational nystagmus was produced, impairment in performance was slight and tended to be if anything greater for the nonsense sequences than for the spatial, the opposite of the prediction of the eye movement hypothesis.

有人提出，语音回路是一个能够通过结合被动的语音存储和主动的发音来维持信息的主动系统，这种方式允许信息内部输入到存储中，从而刷新记忆痕迹。考虑到视觉空间画板似乎也能作为一个可以维护信息的主动存储系统，这就引发了一个问题：是什么过程负责维护这种记忆痕迹？一个经常被提出的观点是，眼动参与到建立、维护或检索视觉空间图像中（例如，可以参考 Hebb 1968 年的研究）。然而，总的来说，支持这种观点的证据不多，主要是来自于尝试监测受试者在被指示形成视觉图像时的眼动，这些尝试通常得到的是微弱或相互矛盾的结果（例如，可以参考 Brown 1968 年和 Hiscock & Bergstrom 1981 年的研究）。这种方法有点像通过监测发音肌肉的电极活动来研究语音回路。确实，这样的技术已经被用来研究低声言语，产生了不同程度和可靠性的效果，但几乎没有揭示底层过程的信息。鉴于我们的一个受试者虽然不能控制他的发音肌肉，但似乎拥有完全充分的内在言语，监测言语肌肉活动似乎不太可能准确反映语音回路的活动。

在研究语音回路时，一种更有效的方法是通过抑制来进行。那么，眼动是否可能抑制空间编码呢？Nancy V. 在范德比尔特大学的未发表研究提供了一些证据，表明光学性的眼震可能会干扰视觉想象的使用。因此，我们决定探究让受试者坐在旋转椅上并进行剧烈旋转对 Brooks 想象任务的影响（Idzikowski 等人，1983 年）。这一严苛实验的结果相当令人失望。尽管确实产生了明显的旋转后眼震，但对性能的影响微乎其微，如果有影响的话，对无意义序列的影响似乎比对空间序列的影响要大，这与眼动假设的预期正相反。

Nevertheless, arguing that the crucial rehearsal-controlling process may not be the eye movements themselves but rather the central system involved in their voluntary control, we decided to press on. We therefore opted for a technique more closely analogous to articulatory suppression, in which the subject actively tracks with his eyes a target following a sinusoidal path on the visual display unit of a computer. We had a second condition in which the target remained stationary, and the background moved sinusoidally, allowing us to determine whether any observed effects were due to the movement of the eyes, or simply to erasure of the image by the movement of the retinal image. Finally, to be certain that fixating a stationary target was not in itself disruptive, we included a free condition in which subjects could move their eyes as much or little as they chose. Despite the complex design, the pattern of results was relatively simple. As figure 4 shows, movement of the eyes disrupted performance on the Spatial, but not the nonsense, task. However, requiring the eyes to remain stationary, or moving the background, had no substantial effect on performance.

In conclusion, the visuo-spatial scratch-pad appears to comprise a store linked with a rehearsal process, in this case that used voluntarily to control eye movements. T As with the articulatory loop, the crucial feature appears to be the central controlling system rather than the peripheral effector system. The imagery system seems to be spatial rather than purely visual in nature, although this may simply reflect the fact that we have so far only succeeded in finding spatial disruption of tasks, attempts to produce equivalent disruption by using nonspatial pictorial tasks being on the whole much less successful (Baddeley Lieberman I980)

Of the many questions that remain to be answered in the area of visual working memory, several seem likely to reward further investigation. These include the relation between the isuo-spatial scratch-pad and  (i) visual short-term memory  (see Phillips, this symposium) ii) the perception and retention of objects, scenes and faces (see Bruce, this symposium), and (iii) the non-phonological "visual short-term store involved in remembering visually presented letters described in the previous section.

尽管如此，我们认为可能并非眼动本身，而是参与控制眼动的中央系统才是重复练习过程的关键，因此我们决定继续研究。因此，我们采用了一种更贴近于言语抑制的技术，即让受试者积极地用眼睛追踪一个在计算机显示屏上沿正弦轨迹移动的目标。我们还设置了一个条件，使目标保持不动而背景发生正弦波动，以此来判断观察到的效果是由于眼睛移动还是仅仅因为视网膜图像移动导致的图像消失。最后，为了确认固定一个静态目标本身是否会造成干扰，我们加入了一个自由条件，允许受试者随意移动眼睛。尽管实验设计复杂，但结果模式相对简单。正如图 4 所展示的，眼睛的移动干扰了空间任务的性能，但并未影响无意义任务。然而，要求眼睛保持静止或是移动背景对性能没有显著影响。

总的来说，视觉空间画板似乎包含了一个存储库和一个重复练习过程，后者在这种情况下是用于自愿控制眼动的。与语音回路相似，关键特性似乎是中央控制系统，而非外围执行系统。想象系统看起来更多地基于空间而非纯视觉，尽管这可能只是反映了我们迄今为止只成功发现了任务的空间干扰，而使用非空间图形任务尝试产生等效干扰的尝试总体上成功率较低（Baddeley Lieberman 1980）。

在视觉工作记忆领域，还有许多问题待解答，其中一些问题通过进一步的研究可能会得到有益的探索。这包括视觉空间画板与视觉短期记忆之间的关系、物体、场景和面孔的感知与记忆，以及前一部分提到的，涉及记忆视觉呈现的字母的非语言「视觉短期存储」。

### 08. Applying the Concept of Working Memory

I have so far attempted to illustrate how the concept of working memory can be broken do into subcomponents, and these in turn analysed in some detail. However, the essence of the concept of working memory lies in its concern with the use of temporary storage to perform such important cognitive tasks as reasoning, comprehension and learning. Consequently, in parallel with the more detailed theoretical analysis of subcomponents, we have been concerned to use what we know of working memory to help understand other more ecologically relevant information-processing tasks. Unfortunately, space does not permit a detailed account of such applications. These involve, in our own case, the study of both fluent reading and learning to read  (Baddeley 1978, 1982; Baddeley Lewis 1981; Baddeley et al. 1981). The concept of working memory has also been useful in approaching the breakdown of normal cognitive functioning, including the nature of the deficit in patients suffering from impaired short-term memory (Vallar& Baddeley 1983) and of the reading problems encountered in developmentally dyslexic boys  (Baddeley et al. 1982). In addition, the concept of working memory has proved useful in analysing the cognitive processes involved in simple arithmetic  (Hitch 1978), and as the next paper will show, in understanding the development of working memory through childhood.

我试图展示了工作记忆的概念是如何被细分为子组件，并对这些子组件进行了详尽的分析。但是，工作记忆概念的核心在于其对使用临时存储完成推理、理解和学习等重要认知任务的重视。因此，在对子组件进行深入理论分析的同时，我们也致力于应用我们对工作记忆的理解来辅助解读其他更具生态意义的信息处理任务。遗憾的是，篇幅限制使我们无法详细讲述这些应用。这包括我们自身的研究，例如流畅阅读和学习阅读的研究（Baddeley 1978, 1982; Baddeley Lewis 1981; Baddeley et al. 1981）。此外，工作记忆概念在分析正常认知功能失调，包括受损短期记忆患者的缺陷性质（Vallar& Baddeley 1983）以及发展性阅读障碍儿童所遇到的阅读问题（Baddeley et al. 1982）方面也显示出其价值。此外，工作记忆概念在分析涉及简单算术的认知过程（Hitch 1978）方面也被证实非常有用，正如下一篇文章将展示的，它在理解儿童时期工作记忆的发展过程中也发挥了重要作用。

### 09. Conclusion

The concept of working memory is a very general one, replacing the idea of a single unitary short-term memory with an alliance of subsystems. We have as yet made progress in analysing only two of what may prove to be a number of such component systems, and have only begun to tackle the important question of how the information from such systems is coordinated. None the less, I think we can claim to have had some success in teasing out the details of at least two of the systems, the articulatory loop and the visuo-spatial scratch-pad. Furthermore, the Concept of a working memory appears to conceptualize the advances we have made in the laboratory in such a way that they can be applied to ecologically relevant cognitive tasks such as reading and arithmetic. Finally, I would like to claim that work in this area has been cumulative. Although the fashion for carrying out work on short-term and working memory has oscillated widely during the last 25 years we have made genuine steady progress. Empirical work such as that of Conrad  (1962) and theoretical work such as that of Broadbent (1958) continue to be influential; we know considerably more about the phenomena and have more elaborate models, but these are essentially developments of the earlier approach rather than completely new departures.

One factor that is different in emphasis from the 1960s, however, is the blurring of the distinction between memory and other cognitive processes. It seems likely that working memory uses components of many other cognitive systems, notably those involved in perception and action in general, and speech perception and production in particular. This inevitably means that we are unlikely to understand working memory fully until we understand perception decision and thought. Thus it seems likely that the topic of working memory will provide challenging and important questions for many years to come.

I am grateful to Douglas Hintzman and Tim Shallice for comments on an earlier draft.

工作记忆的理念极其广泛，它不再将短期记忆视为单一的统一体，而是看作是由多个子系统组成的联盟。目前，我们在分析这些可能存在的多个组成系统中只取得了两个系统的研究进展，并且刚刚开始探索这些系统的信息如何协同工作这一重要议题。尽管如此，我相信我们已经成功揭示了至少两个系统 —— 语音回路（articulatory loop）和视觉空间画板（visuo-spatial scratch-pad）的详细机制。此外，工作记忆的概念好似将我们在实验室中取得的进展抽象化，以至于这些进展可以被应用到与生态相关的认知任务上，比如阅读和算数。最后，我想说，这一领域的研究是在不断积累的。虽然在过去 25 年间，关于短期记忆和工作记忆研究的趋势有过大起大落，但我们确实实现了持续的进步。像 Conrad（1962 年）的实证研究和 Broadbent（1958 年）的理论工作至今仍然影响深远；我们对这些现象的了解更加深刻，模型也更加精细，但这些基本上是对早期研究方法的发展，而非完全创新。

然而，与 1960 年代相比，记忆与其他认知过程之间的界限变得更加模糊是一个显著不同的焦点。工作记忆似乎融合了许多其他认知系统的元素，特别是那些涉及到感知和行动的总体系统，尤其是语言感知和输出。这意味着，我们不太可能完全理解工作记忆，直到我们全面理解感知、决策和思维过程。因此，工作记忆的研究领域预计将在未来很长一段时间内提出挑战性且重要的问题。

我要感谢 Douglas Hintzman 和 Tim Shallice 对本文早期草案提出的宝贵意见。
