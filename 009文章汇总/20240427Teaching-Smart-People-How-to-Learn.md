Teaching Smart People How to Learn

by Chris Argyris

From the Magazine (May–June 1991)

Any company that aspires to succeed in the tougher business environment of the 1990s must first resolve a basic dilemma: success in the marketplace increasingly depends on learning, yet most people don’t know how to learn. What’s more, those members of the organization that many assume to be the best at learning are, in fact, not very good at it. I am talking about the well-educated, high-powered, high-commitment professionals who occupy key leadership positions in the modern corporation.

Most companies not only have tremendous difficulty addressing this learning dilemma; they aren’t even aware that it exists. The reason: they misunderstand what learning is and how to bring it about. As a result, they tend to make two mistakes in their efforts to become a learning organization.

First, most people define learning too narrowly as mere “problem solving,” so they focus on identifying and correcting errors in the external environment. Solving problems is important. But if learning is to persist, managers and employees must also look inward. They need to reflect critically on their own behavior, identify the ways they often inadvertently contribute to the organization’s problems, and then change how they act. In particular, they must learn how the very way they go about defining and solving problems can be a source of problems in its own right.

I have coined the terms “single loop” and “double loop” learning to capture this crucial distinction. To give a simple analogy: a thermostat that automatically turns on the heat whenever the temperature in a room drops below 68 degrees is a good example of single-loop learning. A thermostat that could ask, “Why am I set at 68 degrees?” and then explore whether or not some other temperature might more economically achieve the goal of heating the room would be engaging in double-loop learning.

Highly skilled professionals are frequently very good at single-loop learning. After all, they have spent much of their lives acquiring academic credentials, mastering one or a number of intellectual disciplines, and applying those disciplines to solve real-world problems. But ironically, this very fact helps explain why professionals are often so bad at double-loop learning.

Put simply, because many professionals are almost always successful at what they do, they rarely experience failure. And because they have rarely failed, they have never learned how to learn from failure. So whenever their single-loop learning strategies go wrong, they become defensive, screen out criticism, and put the “blame” on anyone and everyone but themselves. In short, their ability to learn shuts down precisely at the moment they need it the most.

The propensity among professionals to behave defensively helps shed light on the second mistake that companies make about learning. The common assumption is that getting people to learn is largely a matter of motivation. When people have the right attitudes and commitment, learning automatically follows. So companies focus on creating new organizational structures—compensation programs, performance reviews, corporate cultures, and the like—that are designed to create motivated and committed employees.

任何渴望在 1990 年代竞争激烈的商业环境中脱颖而出的公司，首先必须面对一个根本的挑战：市场的成功越来越依赖于持续学习，但大多数人并不擅长学习。更具讽刺意味的是，那些通常被认为学习能力最强的组织成员，实际上并没有表现出足够的学习能力。这些人是那些受过高等教育、才华横溢且极具责任心的专业人员，他们在现代企业中担任关键领导角色。

不仅大多数公司在解决这种学习难题时感到力不从心，他们甚至没有意识到这个问题的存在。这是因为他们对学习的理解有误，不知道如何有效地促进学习。因此，他们在努力打造学习型组织的过程中通常会犯两个错误。

首先，许多人对学习的定义过于狭窄，仅将其视为「解决问题」，因此他们专注于找出并修正外部环境中的错误。虽然解决问题很关键，但要实现持续的学习，管理层和员工还需要反观自身。他们应当深入反思自己的行为，找出自己在不知不觉中是如何加剧组织问题的，并据此改变自己的行为模式。尤其重要的是，他们需要认识到，他们处理问题的方式本身就可能是问题的一部分。

为了描述这种区分，我特别提出了「单环学习」和「双环学习」这两个概念。以一个简单的类比来说明：一个室温低于 68 度时自动启动暖气的恒温器就是单环学习的典范。而一个能够自问「我为什么要设置在 68 度？」并探索是否有其他更节能的温度设置能达到相同的加热效果的恒温器，则是在进行双环学习。

高技能的专业人员通常在单环学习上表现出色，这主要是因为他们花费了大量时间获取学术资格，掌握各种智力学科，并将这些学科知识应用于解决现实问题。然而，讽刺的是，正是因为他们在这些领域的成就，让他们在双环学习上的表现通常不尽如人意。

简而言之，因为这些专业人士几乎总能在他们的领域内取得成功，他们很少面对失败。而不熟悉失败的经历意味着他们未曾学会从失败中吸取教训。所以，当他们依赖的单环学习策略出现问题时，他们往往会本能地采取防御态度，拒绝接受批评，并将责任推给其他人。总的来说，正当他们最需要学习的时刻，他们的学习能力却戛然而止。

这种专业人士的防御性行为揭示了许多公司在推动学习进程中的另一个误区。人们常常认为，激发学习的关键在于动机。当员工持有正确的态度和承诺时，学习似乎就会自然发生。因此，许多公司侧重于构建能激励员工的新组织结构，如薪酬体系、绩效评价和企业文化等，希望通过这些措施培养员工的积极性和忠诚度。

But effective double-loop learning is not simply a function of how people feel. It is a reflection of how they think—that is, the cognitive rules or reasoning they use to design and implement their actions. Think of these rules as a kind of “master program” stored in the brain, governing all behavior. Defensive reasoning can block learning even when the individual commitment to it is high, just as a computer program with hidden bugs can produce results exactly the opposite of what its designers had planned.
Companies can learn how to resolve the learning dilemma. What it takes is to make the ways managers and employees reason about their behavior a focus of organizational learning and continuous improvement programs. Teaching people how to reason about their behavior in new and more effective ways breaks down the defenses that block learning.

All of the examples that follow involve a particular kind of professional: fast-track consultants at major management consulting companies. But the implications of my argument go far beyond this specific occupational group. The fact is, more and more jobs—no matter what the title—are taking on the contours of “knowledge work.” People at all levels of the organization must combine the mastery of some highly specialized technical expertise with the ability to work effectively in teams, form productive relationships with clients and customers, and critically reflect on and then change their own organizational practices. And the nuts and bolts of management—whether of high-powered consultants or service representatives, senior managers or factory technicians—increasingly consists of guiding and integrating the autonomous but interconnected work of highly skilled people.

然而，有效的双环学习不仅仅取决于个人的感受，更重要的是反映了他们的思考方式 —— 即他们设计和执行行动时所依赖的认知规则或逻辑推理。可以把这些规则想象成大脑中的「主控程序」，它指导着所有的行为。就像带有程序错误的计算机软件可能导致与预期完全相反的结果一样，防御性的思维方式即便在个人非常重视学习的情况下也可能阻碍学习的发生。

公司可以通过将管理者和员工对自身行为的思考方式作为组织学习和持续改进的重点来解决学习的难题。通过教育员工以新的、更有效的方式来分析自己的行为，可以消除那些阻碍学习的心理防线。

所有接下来的例子都涉及到一类特定的专业人士：主要管理咨询公司中职业发展迅速的顾问。然而，我的观点的影响远不止于这个特定的职业群体。事实上，越来越多的职业 —— 无论职位高低 —— 都逐渐展现出「知识工作」的特点。组织中的每一个层面的人都必须将精通某一专业技术的能力与团队合作、与客户建立有效关系的能力以及批判性反思并改进组织实践的能力结合起来。而无论是管理顶尖的咨询师、客户服务代表、高级管理者还是工厂技术人员，管理工作越来越多地涉及到指导和整合这些高技能人员独立而又相互联系的工作。

### 01. How Professionals Avoid Learning

For 15 years, I have been conducting in-depth studies of management consultants. I decided to study consultants for a few simple reasons. First, they are the epitome of the highly educated professionals who play an increasingly central role in all organizations. Almost all of the consultants I’ve studied have MBAs from the top three or four U.S. business schools. They are also highly committed to their work. For instance, at one company, more than 90% of the consultants responded in a survey that they were “highly satisfied” with their jobs and with the company.

I also assumed that such professional consultants would be good at learning. After all, the essence of their job is to teach others how to do things differently. I found, however, that these consultants embodied the learning dilemma. The most enthusiastic about continuous improvement in their own organizations, they were also often the biggest obstacle to its complete success.

Professionals embody the learning dilemma: they are enthusiastic about continuous improvement—and often the biggest obstacle to its success.

As long as efforts at learning and change focused on external organizational factors—job redesign, compensation programs, performance reviews, and leadership training—the professionals were enthusiastic participants. Indeed, creating new systems and structures was precisely the kind of challenge that well-educated, highly motivated professionals thrived on.

And yet the moment the quest for continuous improvement turned to the professionals’ own performance, something went wrong. It wasn’t a matter of bad attitude. The professionals’ commitment to excellence was genuine, and the vision of the company was clear. Nevertheless, continuous improvement did not persist. And the longer the continuous improvement efforts continued, the greater the likelihood that they would produce ever-diminishing returns.

What happened? The professionals began to feel embarrassed. They were threatened by the prospect of critically examining their own role in the organization. Indeed, because they were so well paid (and generally believed that their employers were supportive and fair), the idea that their performance might not be at its best made them feel guilty.

我已经研究管理顾问长达 15 年。选择研究顾问的原因很简单。首先，他们是高教育层次专业人士的代表，在所有类型的组织中都扮演着日益重要的角色。我所研究的顾问几乎都是从美国排名前三或四的商学院获得 MBA 学位的。他们对自己的工作极为投入。例如，在一家公司，超过 90% 的顾问在一项调查中表示，他们对自己的工作及公司感到「非常满意」。

我原本认为这些专业顾问应该擅长学习，毕竟，他们的工作本质上是指导他人以新的方式行事。然而，这些顾问恰恰体现了学习的困境。尽管他们对自己组织的持续改进充满热情，但他们往往成为实现完全成功的最大障碍。

这些专业人士正是学习困境的具体体现：他们对持续改进充满热情，却常常阻碍了其成功。

只要改革和学习的努力聚焦于组织的外部因素 —— 如重新设计职位、调整薪酬结构、绩效评估和领导力培训 —— 这些专业人士总是积极参与。确实，创立新的系统和架构正是这些受过良好教育、积极主动的专业人士擅长的挑战。

但当持续改进的目标转向专业人士自己的表现时，问题就出现了。这并不是因为态度问题。这些专业人士对于卓越有着真诚的追求，公司的愿景也非常清晰。然而，持续改进并未能持续进行。随着持续改进努力的延续，它们带来的收益却呈现递减趋势。

出了什么问题？这些专业人士开始感到不自在。他们对批判性地审视自己在组织中的角色感到恐惧。因为他们收入优厚（而且普遍认为雇主是支持和公正的），意识到自己的表现可能并非最佳让他们感到愧疚。

Far from being a catalyst for real change, such feelings caused most to react defensively. They projected the blame for any problems away from themselves and onto what they said were unclear goals, insensitive and unfair leaders, and stupid clients.

Consider this example. At a premier management consulting company, the manager of a case team called a meeting to examine the team’s performance on a recent consulting project. The client was largely satisfied and had given the team relatively high marks, but the manager believed the team had not created the value added that it was capable of and that the consulting company had promised. In the spirit of continuous improvement, he felt that the team could do better. Indeed, so did some of the team members.

The manager knew how difficult it was for people to reflect critically on their own work performance, especially in the presence of their manager, so he took a number of steps to make possible a frank and open discussion. He invited to the meeting an outside consultant whom team members knew and trusted—“just to keep me honest,” he said. He also agreed to have the entire meeting tape-recorded. That way, any subsequent confusions or disagreements about what went on at the meeting could be checked against the transcript. Finally, the manager opened the meeting by emphasizing that no subject was off limits—including his own behavior.

“I realize that you may believe you cannot confront me,” the manager said. “But I encourage you to challenge me. You have a responsibility to tell me where you think the leadership made mistakes, just as I have the responsibility to identify any I believe you made. And all of us must acknowledge our own mistakes. If we do not have an open dialogue, we will not learn.”

The professionals took the manager up on the first half of his invitation but quietly ignored the second. When asked to pinpoint the key problems in the experience with the client, they looked entirely outside themselves. The clients were uncooperative and arrogant. “They didn’t think we could help them.” The team’s own managers were unavailable and poorly prepared. “At times, our managers were not up to speed before they walked into the client meetings.” In effect, the professionals asserted that they were helpless to act differently—not because of any limitations of their own but because of the limitations of others.

这种感受并没有成为促进真正变革的催化剂，相反，它让大多数人开始防守反击。他们不是对自己的行为负责，而是把问题归咎于所谓的不明确的目标、不近人情和不公正的领导，以及愚蠢的客户。

以这个情况为例。在一家顶尖的管理咨询公司，一个项目团队的经理召开了一次会议，评估团队在最近的一个咨询项目中的表现。虽然客户基本满意，给了团队相对较高的评分，但经理认为团队未能创造出其本应达到的附加价值，也未能实现咨询公司的承诺。出于对持续改进的追求，他认为团队有能力做得更好。事实上，团队中的一些成员也这样认为。

经理深知在经理面前批判性地审视自己的工作表现是多么困难，因此他采取了若干措施，确保会议能够开展坦率且开放的讨论。他邀请了一个团队成员们熟悉并信赖的外部顾问参加会议 —— 他说这是为了「确保自己保持诚实」。他还同意录音整个会议，以便会后能够对任何对会议内容的误解或分歧进行核查。开会时，他首先明确表示，包括他自身行为在内，没有任何话题是禁区。

「我知道你们可能觉得无法直接对我提出挑战，」经理说。「但我鼓励你们质疑我。你们有责任向我指出领导层的错误，正如我有责任指出我认为你们犯的错误一样。我们都必须承认自己的失误。如果我们不能进行开放的对话，我们就无法学习。」

专业人士接受了经理的邀请，但只对其中的一部分做出了回应。当被要求指出与客户合作中遇到的主要问题时，他们完全不愿意从自身找原因。他们认为客户不合作且傲慢，「他们认为我们帮不了他们」。他们还指责自己的管理者不可靠、准备不足，「有时，我们的管理者在参加客户会议之前并未充分准备。」实际上，这些专业人士声称，他们无法采取不同的行动，不是因为自己有什么不足，而是受到了他人的限制。

The manager listened carefully to the team members and tried to respond to their criticisms. He talked about the mistakes that he had made during the consulting process. For example, one professional objected to the way the manager had run the project meetings. “I see that the way I asked questions closed down discussions,” responded the manager. “I didn’t mean to do that, but I can see how you might have believed that I had already made up my mind.” Another team member complained that the manager had caved in to pressure from his superior to produce the project report far too quickly, considering the team’s heavy work load. “I think that it was my responsibility to have said no,” admitted the manager. “It was clear that we all had an immense amount of work.”

Finally, after some three hours of discussion about his own behavior, the manager began to ask the team members if there were any errors they might have made. “After all,” he said, “this client was not different from many others. How can we be more effective in the future?”

The professionals repeated that it was really the clients’ and their own managers’ fault. As one put it, “They have to be open to change and want to learn.” The more the manager tried to get the team to examine its own responsibility for the outcome, the more the professionals bypassed his concerns. The best one team member could suggest was for the case team to “promise less”—implying that there was really no way for the group to improve its performance.

The case team members were reacting defensively to protect themselves, even though their manager was not acting in ways that an outsider would consider threatening. Even if there were some truth to their charges—the clients may well have been arrogant and closed, their own managers distant—the way they presented these claims was guaranteed to stop learning. With few exceptions, the professionals made attributions about the behavior of the clients and the managers but never publicly tested their claims. For instance, they said that the clients weren’t motivated to learn but never really presented any evidence supporting that assertion. When their lack of concrete evidence was pointed out to them, they simply repeated their criticisms more vehemently.

If the professionals had felt so strongly about these issues, why had they never mentioned them during the project? According to the professionals, even this was the fault of others. “We didn’t want to alienate the client,” argued one. “We didn’t want to be seen as whining,” said another.

经理仔细听取了团队成员的意见，并尝试回应他们的批评。他讲述了自己在咨询过程中犯的一些错误。例如，一位专业人士指出经理管理项目会议的方式不当。「我意识到我提问的方式可能阻止了更深入的讨论，」经理回应，「我并不是有意为之，但我能理解你们可能觉得我已经做好了决定。」另一名团队成员则抱怨说，经理在上级的压力下过快地提交了项目报告，没有考虑到团队繁重的工作量。「我应该拒绝的，」经理坦承，「显然，我们都负担过重。」

在讨论了自己行为大约三个小时后，经理开始询问团队成员是否也有犯错的可能。「毕竟，」他说，「这个客户并不比其他客户特殊。我们未来如何能做得更好？」

专业人士再次重申问题主要是客户和他们自己的管理者。「他们必须愿意接受变化并学习新事物。」尽管经理努力让团队审视自身的责任，专业人士却更多地绕开了他的关切。团队成员提出的最好建议是「少做承诺」，这隐含着团队实际上没有办法提高自己的表现。

案例团队成员采取防御态度保护自己，尽管从外人看来，经理的行为并不具威胁性。即使他们的指控有一定的真实性 —— 客户可能确实傲慢且不愿开放，他们的管理者可能也不够接近 —— 他们提出这些指控的方式确保了不会有任何学习发生。在大多数情况下，专业人士都是在对客户和管理者的行为进行归咎，而没有公开验证这些说法。比如，他们指责客户没有学习的意愿，但从未提出实际证据支持这一点。当指出他们缺乏具体证据时，他们只是更加强烈地重复自己的批评。

这些专业人士对这些问题有如此强烈的感受，为什么他们在项目进行期间从未提出过呢？根据他们的说法，这甚至也是别人的责任。「我们不想使客户感到被疏远，」一位成员解释说。「我们不想显得在抱怨，」另一位补充道。

The professionals were using their criticisms of others to protect themselves from the potential embarrassment of having to admit that perhaps they too had contributed to the team’s less-than-perfect performance. What’s more, the fact that they kept repeating their defensive actions in the face of the manager’s efforts to turn the group’s attention to its own role shows that this defensiveness had become a reflexive routine. From the professionals’ perspective, they weren’t resisting; they were focusing on the “real” causes. Indeed, they were to be respected, if not congratulated, for working as well as they did under such difficult conditions.

It’s not enough to talk candidly. Professionals can still find themselves talking past each other.

The end result was an unproductive parallel conversation. Both the manager and the professionals were candid; they expressed their views forcefully. But they talked past each other, never finding a common language to describe what had happened with the client. The professionals kept insisting that the fault lay with others. The manager kept trying, unsuccessfully, to get the professionals to see how they contributed to the state of affairs they were criticizing. The dialogue of this parallel conversation looks like this:

Professionals: “The clients have to be open. They must want to change.”

Manager: “It’s our task to help them see that change is in their interest.”

Professionals: “But the clients didn’t agree with our analyses.”

Manager: “If they didn’t think our ideas were right, how might we have convinced them?”

Professionals: “Maybe we need to have more meetings with the client.”
Manager: “If we aren’t adequately prepared and if the clients don’t think we’re credible, how will more meetings help?”

Professionals: “There should be better communication between case team members and management.”

Manager: “I agree. But professionals should take the initiative to educate the manager about the problems they are experiencing.”

Professionals: “Our leaders are unavailable and distant.”

Manager: “How do you expect us to know that if you don’t tell us?”

Conversations such as this one dramatically illustrate the learning dilemma. The problem with the professionals’ claims is not that they are wrong but that they aren’t useful. By constantly turning the focus away from their own behavior to that of others, the professionals bring learning to a grinding halt. The manager understands the trap but does not know how to get out of it. To learn how to do that requires going deeper into the dynamics of defensive reasoning—and into the special causes that make professionals so prone to it.

专业人士通过批评他人自我保护，以免面对一个可能的尴尬事实 —— 即他们自己可能也对团队表现不佳有责任。更重要的是，他们在经理努力将团队焦点转向内部时，反复采取的防御性行为表明，这已成为一种条件反射。在专业人士看来，他们不是在抵抗，而是在关注「真正的」问题。实际上，在如此困难的条件下，他们依然能保持良好表现，确实值得尊敬，甚至值得称赞。

单纯坦诚的交流是不够的，专业人士还是可能会话不投机。

最终的对话成了一场效率极低的平行对话。经理和专业人士都表达得很坦率，他们强力表达了自己的观点。但他们彼此之间的对话却是错位的，未能找到共同的语言来描述与客户之间发生的事情。专业人士一再强调错误在别人身上。经理则一直尝试（但未能成功）让专业人士认识到他们对所批评的局面所做的贡献。这场对话大致如下：

专业人士：「客户必须要开放，他们必须要有改变的意愿。」

经理：「让他们明白改变符合他们的利益，这是我们的任务。」

专业人士：「但客户并不认同我们的分析。」

经理：「如果他们不认为我们的观点是正确的，我们应如何说服他们呢？」

专业人士：「也许我们需要与客户开更多的会议。」

经理：「如果我们准备不足，而且客户不认为我们可信，开更多的会议又有何帮助呢？」

专业人士：「应该在案例团队成员和管理层之间加强沟通。」

经理：「我同意。但专业人士应该主动向管理者报告他们遇到的问题。」

专业人士：「我们的领导人接触不到，而且态度冷淡。」

经理：「如果你们不告诉我们，你们期望我们怎样了解情况呢？」

这样的对话鲜明地揭示了学习的难题。专业人士的观点问题不在于是否正确，而在于它们缺乏实用性。他们不断地把注意力从自己的行为转移到他人身上，从而使学习陷入停滞。经理明白这一困境，却无法找到摆脱的方法。要解决这个问题，必须更深入地探索防御性推理的机制及其让专业人士特别容易陷入的原因。

### 02. Defensive Reasoning and the Doom Loop

What explains the professionals’ defensiveness? Not their attitudes about change or commitment to continuous improvement; they really wanted to work more effectively. Rather, the key factor is the way they reasoned about their behavior and that of others.

It is impossible to reason anew in every situation. If we had to think through all the possible responses every time someone asked, “How are you?” the world would pass us by. Therefore, everyone develops a theory of action—a set of rules that individuals use to design and implement their own behavior as well as to understand the behavior of others. Usually, these theories of actions become so taken for granted that people don’t even realize they are using them.
One of the paradoxes of human behavior, however, is that the master program people actually use is rarely the one they think they use. Ask people in an interview or questionnaire to articulate the rules they use to govern their actions, and they will give you what I call their “espoused” theory of action. But observe these same people’s behavior, and you will quickly see that this espoused theory has very little to do with how they actually behave. For example, the professionals on the case team said they believed in continuous improvement, and yet they consistently acted in ways that made improvement impossible.

防御性推理与恶性循环

引发专业人士防御性的并非他们对变革的态度或持续改进的承诺；他们确实希望更高效地工作。关键在于他们如何推理自己及他人的行为。

在每种情况下都进行全新的推理是不现实的。如果每次别人问我们「你好吗？」时我们都要思考所有可能的回答，我们就会错失生活中的很多事情。因此，每个人都会形成一套行动理论 —— 这是一组规则，用于指导个人设计和执行自己的行为，并理解他人的行为。这些行动理论通常被视为理所当然，以至于人们甚至没有意识到自己在使用它们。

然而，人类行为的一个悖论是，人们实际采用的主程序很少是他们认为自己在使用的那个。如果你让人们在面试或问卷中描述他们用来指导行为的规则，他们会给出他们所声称的行动理论。但是，如果你观察这些人的实际行为，你会很快发现，他们所声称的理论与他们的实际行为关系不大。例如，案例团队中的专业人士声称他们信奉持续改进，然而他们的实际行为却一再显示出阻碍改进的态度。

When you observe people’s behavior and try to come up with rules that would make sense of it, you discover a very different theory of action—what I call the individual’s “theory-in-use.” Put simply, people consistently act inconsistently, unaware of the contradiction between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use, between the way they think they are acting and the way they really act.

What’s more, most theories-in-use rest on the same set of governing values. There seems to be a universal human tendency to design one’s actions consistently according to four basic values:

1. To remain in unilateral control;

2. To maximize “winning” and minimize “losing”;

3. To suppress negative feelings; and

4. To be as “rational” as possible—by which people mean defining clear objectives and evaluating their behavior in terms of whether or not they have achieved them.

The purpose of all these values is to avoid embarrassment or threat, feeling vulnerable or incompetent. In this respect, the master program that most people use is profoundly defensive. Defensive reasoning encourages individuals to keep private the premises, inferences, and conclusions that shape their behavior and to avoid testing them in a truly independent, objective fashion.

Because the attributions that go into defensive reasoning are never really tested, it is a closed loop, remarkably impervious to conflicting points of view. The inevitable response to the observation that somebody is reasoning defensively is yet more defensive reasoning. With the case team, for example, whenever anyone pointed out the professionals’ defensive behavior to them, their initial reaction was to look for the cause in somebody else—clients who were so sensitive that they would have been alienated if the consultants had criticized them or a manager so weak that he couldn’t have taken it had the consultants raised their concerns with him. In other words, the case team members once again denied their own responsibility by externalizing the problem and putting it on someone else.

当我们观察人们的行为并尝试找出其背后的规律时，我们会发现一种完全不同的行为理论 —— 即我所说的「实际应用理论」。简单来说，人们的行为常常是自相矛盾的，他们没有察觉到自己表面上声称的理论与实际应用中的理论之间，以及他们以为的行为方式与实际行为方式之间的差异。

更进一步，大多数实际应用的理论都基于相同的核心价值观。人们似乎普遍倾向于根据以下四个基本价值观来设计自己的行动：

1. 保持绝对的控制权；

2. 尽可能赢得胜利，避免失败；

3. 抑制消极情绪；

4. 力求合理 —— 即明确目标，并根据是否达成这些目标来评估自己的行为。

所有这些价值观的根本目的是为了避免尴尬或威胁，防止自己感觉脆弱或无能。在这方面，大多数人所遵循的主要程序具有深刻的防御性。防御性思维鼓励个体隐藏影响其行为的假设、推理和结论，避免在真正独立和客观的场合中进行验证。

由于防御性思维中的假设从未真正接受检验，它形成了一个封闭的循环，对于不同的观点几乎完全封闭。当观察到某人采用防御性思维时，他们通常会用更多的防御性思维来回应。例如，在案例小组中，当有人指出专业人士的防御性行为时，他们首先会把原因归咎于其他人 —— 比如客户太敏感，批评会让他们感到不适，或者经理太无力，无法接受批评。换言之，小组成员再次通过将问题外化并归咎于别人，来回避自身的责任。

In such situations, the simple act of encouraging more open inquiry is often attacked by others as “intimidating.” Those who do the attacking deal with their feelings about possibly being wrong by blaming the more open individual for arousing these feelings and upsetting them.

Needless to say, such a master program inevitably short-circuits learning. And for a number of reasons unique to their psychology, well-educated professionals are especially susceptible to this.

Nearly all the consultants I have studied have stellar academic records. Ironically, their very success at education helps explain the problems they have with learning. Before they enter the world of work, their lives are primarily full of successes, so they have rarely experienced the embarrassment and sense of threat that comes with failure. As a result, their defensive reasoning has rarely been activated. People who rarely experience failure, however, end up not knowing how to deal with it effectively. And this serves to reinforce the normal human tendency to reason defensively.

The very success of professionals at education helps explain the problems they have with learning.

In a survey of several hundred young consultants at the organizations I have been studying, these professionals describe themselves as driven internally by an unrealistically high ideal of performance: “Pressure on the job is self-imposed.” “I must not only do a good job; I must also be the best.” “People around here are very bright and hardworking; they are highly motivated to do an outstanding job.” “Most of us want not only to succeed but also to do so at maximum speed.”

These consultants are always comparing themselves with the best around them and constantly trying to better their own performance. And yet they do not appreciate being required to compete openly with each other. They feel it is somehow inhumane. They prefer to be the individual contributor—what might be termed a “productive loner.”

Behind this high aspiration success is an equally high fear of failure and a propensity to feel shame and guilt when they do fail to meet their high standards. “You must avoid mistakes,” said one. “I hate making them. Many of us fear failure, whether we admit it or not.”

在这样的情形下，仅仅是鼓励开放的探讨，就经常被别人攻击，说是「恐吓」。发起攻击的人通过指责那些开放的个体引发了这些不安的情绪，来处理自己可能犯错的恐惧。

显然，这种固有的思维模式不可避免地阻碍了学习的过程。由于特定的心理特点，受过良好教育的专业人士尤其容易陷入这种情况。

我所研究的几乎所有顾问都有卓越的学术背景。讽刺的是，正是他们在学术上的成功，导致了他们在学习新事物时的困难。在步入职场之前，他们的生活几乎充满了成功，很少体验到失败带来的尴尬和威胁。因此，他们很少触发防御性思维。然而，很少经历失败的人最终不懂得如何有效应对失败。这反过来又加剧了人们本能的防御性思维倾向。

在教育上的巨大成功有助于解释专业人士在学习上遇到的问题。

在我研究的几个机构中对数百名年轻顾问进行的调查中，这些专业人士形容自己是由不切实际的高标准驱动的：「工作上的压力是自己给自己的。」「我不仅要做得好，还要做到最好。」「这里的人都很聪明、勤奋，他们极其渴望出色地完成工作。」「我们中的大多数人不仅想要成功，还想迅速达到成功。」

这些顾问总是在与周围最优秀的人比较，并不断努力超越自己的表现。然而，他们并不喜欢被明确要求与他人公开竞争。他们认为这种做法在某种程度上是不人道的。他们更倾向于成为独立的贡献者 —— 可以称为「高效的孤独者」。

这种高追求背后，同样深藏着对失败的极大恐惧，以及未能达到高标准时的羞愧和内疚。「你必须避免犯错，」一位顾问说。「我讨厌犯错误。我们很多人都害怕失败，不管我们是否愿意承认。」

To the extent that these consultants have experienced success in their lives, they have not had to be concerned about failure and the attendant feelings of shame and guilt. But to exactly the same extent, they also have never developed the tolerance for feelings of failure or the skills to deal with these feelings. This in turn has led them not only to fear failure but also to fear the fear of failure itself. For they know that they will not cope with it superlatively—their usual level of aspiration.

The consultants use two intriguing metaphors to describe this phenomenon. They talk about the “doom loop” and “doom zoom.” Often, consultants will perform well on the case team, but because they don’t do the jobs perfectly or receive accolades from their managers, they go into a doom loop of despair. And they don’t ease into the doom loop, they zoom into it.

When professionals don’t do their jobs perfectly, they zoom into a “doom loop.”

As a result, many professionals have extremely “brittle” personalities. When suddenly faced with a situation they cannot immediately handle, they tend to fall apart. They cover up their distress in front of the client. They talk about it constantly with their fellow case team members. Interestingly, these conversations commonly take the form of bad-mouthing clients.

Such brittleness leads to an inappropriately high sense of despondency or even despair when people don’t achieve the high levels of performance they aspire to. Such despondency is rarely psychologically devastating, but when combined with defensive reasoning, it can result in a formidable predisposition against learning.

There is no better example of how this brittleness can disrupt an organization than performance evaluations. Because it represents the one moment when a professional must measure his or her own behavior against some formal standard, a performance evaluation is almost tailor-made to push a professional into the doom loop. Indeed, a poor evaluation can reverberate far beyond the particular individual involved to spark defensive reasoning throughout an entire organization.

Performance evaluation is tailor-made to push professionals into the doom loop.

在这些顾问所经历的成功程度上，他们从未需要担忧失败及伴随的羞愧和内疚感。然而，同样地，他们也从未培养出对失败感觉的耐受能力或应对这些感觉的技巧。这最终使他们不仅害怕失败，更害怕对失败的恐惧本身。因为他们知道自己无法以通常追求的卓越水平来应对失败。

顾问们用两个生动的比喻来形容这一现象 —— 他们称之为「灾难循环」和「灾难冲刺」。通常，顾问在团队中表现出色，但如果他们没有完美地完成任务或没有获得经理的表扬，他们就会迅速陷入绝望的灾难循环中。

当专业人士未能完美地完成任务时，他们会迅速进入「灾难循环」。

因此，很多专业人士的性格极为敏感脆弱。当他们突然遇到自己无法立即解决的问题时，他们往往会情绪崩溃。他们会在客户面前掩饰自己的苦楚，并且不断地与团队成员讨论这个问题。有趣的是，这些讨论通常表现为对客户的不满。

这种敏感脆弱会导致人们在未能达到自己追求的高标准时感到过度的沮丧甚至绝望。这种沮丧虽然很少对心理造成严重伤害，但如果与防御性思维结合，就可能形成强烈的抗学习倾向。

没有比绩效评估更能说明这种脆弱如何扰乱组织的例子了。因为绩效评估正是专业人士必须依据某种标准评估自身行为的时刻，几乎是专门设计来推动专业人士进入灾难循环的。实际上，一次不佳的评估不仅会影响到相关个体，还会在整个组织中引发防御性思维。

绩效评估正是为了推动专业人士进入灾难循环而专门设计的。

At one consulting company, management established a new performance-evaluation process that was designed to make evaluations both more objective and more useful to those being evaluated. The consultants participated in the design of the new system and in general were enthusiastic because it corresponded to their espoused values of objectivity and fairness. A brief two years into the new process, however, it had become the object of dissatisfaction. The catalyst for this about-face was the first unsatisfactory rating.

Senior managers had identified six consultants whose performance they considered below standard. In keeping with the new evaluation process, they did all they could to communicate their concerns to the six and to help them improve. Managers met with each individual separately for as long and as often as the professional requested to explain the reasons behind the rating and to discuss what needed to be done to improve—but to no avail. Performance continued at the same low level and, eventually, the six were let go.

When word of the dismissal spread through the company, people responded with confusion and anxiety. After about a dozen consultants angrily complained to management, the CEO held two lengthy meetings where employees could air their concerns.

At the meetings, the professionals made a variety of claims. Some said the performance-evaluation process was unfair because judgments were subjective and biased and the criteria for minimum performance unclear. Others suspected that the real cause for the dismissals was economic and that the performance-evaluation procedure was just a fig leaf to hide the fact that the company was in trouble. Still others argued that the evaluation process was antilearning. If the company were truly a learning organization, as it claimed, then people performing below the minimum standard should be taught how to reach it. As one professional put it: “We were told that the company did not have an up-or-out policy. Up-or-out is inconsistent with learning. You misled us.”

The CEO tried to explain the logic behind management’s decision by grounding it in the facts of the case and by asking the professionals for any evidence that might contradict these facts.

Is there subjectivity and bias in the evaluation process? Yes, responded the CEO, but “we strive hard to reduce them. We are constantly trying to improve the process. If you have any ideas, please tell us. If you know of someone treated unfairly, please bring it up. If any of you feel that you have been treated unfairly, let’s discuss it now or, if you wish, privately.”

在一家咨询公司，管理层引入了一个新的绩效评估系统，目的是使评估过程更加客观，同时对被评估的顾问更具帮助性。顾问们参与了这一系统的设计，并普遍对其表现出热情，因为它符合他们所倡导的客观和公平的价值观。然而，仅两年后，新系统就遭到了广泛的抱怨，触发这一转变的是第一次不满意的评级。

高层管理者指出了六名表现不达标的顾问。按照新评估流程，他们尽力向这六人传达关切，并助其改进。管理层与每位顾问单独会谈，尽可能地根据他们的需求解释评级背后的原因及改进措施，但均未奏效。这些顾问的表现依旧未见提升，最终被公司解雇。

当解雇消息在公司内部传播时，员工们感到困惑和焦虑。十几位顾问向管理层表达了愤怒，CEO 随后召开了两次长时间的会议，以便员工们表达担忧。

在这些会议上，顾问们提出了多种观点。一些人认为绩效评估过程不公正，认为评价带有主观性和偏见，且最低绩效标准不明确。还有些人怀疑解雇的真实原因是公司经济问题，而绩效评估只是掩饰真相的幌子。还有人指出，这种评估流程抵制学习。如果公司真的是一个学习型组织，那么表现不佳的员工应该得到教导，学习如何达标。正如一位顾问所言：「公司明确告诉我们没有升迁或出局的政策。这种政策与促进学习的理念不符，这是误导。」

CEO 尝试解释管理层决策的逻辑，他基于案例的事实，并询问专业人员是否有任何可能与这些事实相悖的证据。

关于评估过程的主观性和偏见问题，CEO 承认这一点，但他强调：「我们正在努力减少这些问题。我们在不断改进这个流程。如果你有好的建议，请告诉我们。如果你知道有人受到不公平对待，也请提出。如果你感觉自己受到了不公平对待，我们可以现在讨论，或者你可以选择私下讨论。」

Is the level of minimum competence too vague? “We are working to define minimum competence more clearly,” he answered. “In the case of the six, however, their performance was so poor that it wasn’t difficult to reach a decision.” Most of the six had received timely feedback about their problems. And in the two cases where people had not, the reason was that they had never taken the responsibility to seek out evaluations—and, indeed, had actively avoided them. “If you have any data to the contrary,” the CEO added, “let’s talk about it.”

Were the six asked to leave for economic reasons? No, said the CEO. “We have more work than we can do, and letting professionals go is extremely costly for us. Do any of you have any information to the contrary?”

As to the company being antilearning, in fact, the entire evaluation process was designed to encourage learning. When a professional is performing below the minimum level, the CEO explained, “we jointly design remedial experiences with the individual. Then we look for signs of improvement. In these cases, either the professionals were reluctant to take on such assignments or they repeatedly failed when they did. Again, if you have information or evidence to the contrary, I’d like to hear about it.”

The CEO concluded: “It’s regrettable, but sometimes we make mistakes and hire the wrong people. If individuals don’t produce and repeatedly prove themselves unable to improve, we don’t know what else to do except dismiss them. It’s just not fair to keep poorly performing individuals in the company. They earn an unfair share of the financial rewards.”

Instead of responding with data of their own, the professionals simply repeated their accusations but in ways that consistently contradicted their claims. They said that a genuinely fair evaluation process would contain clear and documentable data about performance—but they were unable to provide firsthand examples of the unfairness that they implied colored the evaluation of the six dismissed employees. They argued that people shouldn’t be judged by inferences unconnected to their actual performance—but they judged management in precisely this way. They insisted that management define clear, objective, and unambiguous performance standards—but they argued that any humane system would take into account that the performance of a professional cannot be precisely measured. Finally, they presented themselves as champions of learning—but they never proposed any criteria for assessing whether an individual might be unable to learn.

「最低能力标准是否太模糊了？」他回答说：「我们正在努力使最低能力标准更加明确。」然而，对于这六个人来说，他们的表现如此之差，以至于做出决定并不难。」这六人中的大部分都及时得到了关于他们问题的反馈。在两个没有得到反馈的例子中，问题在于他们从未主动寻求评估 —— 实际上，他们还刻意回避了这些评估。「如果你们有任何相反的数据，」首席执行官补充说，「我们可以讨论一下。」

这六人是因为经济原因被要求离开的吗？首席执行官否认了这一点。「我们手头的工作比我们能完成的还要多，让专业人士离开对我们来说成本极高。你们有任何相反的信息吗？」

至于公司反对学习的看法，实际上，整个评估过程正是为了鼓励学习。首席执行官解释说：「当某位专业人士的表现不达标时，我们会与他们共同制定补救措施。然后我们寻找他们是否有所改进。在这些情况中，要么是这些专业人士不愿意接受这些任务，要么是他们在执行这些任务时反复失败。如果你们有任何相反的信息或证据，我很乐意听听。」

首席执行官总结道：「这确实很遗憾，但有时我们确实会犯错，招错人。如果有人无法提供成果并且反复证明自己无法改进，我们也不知道还能做什么，只能选择让他们离开。继续雇用表现不佳的员工对公司是不公平的。他们获得的财务回报并不公平。」

专业人士并没有用自己的数据来回应，而是一再以自相矛盾的方式重复他们的指责。他们声称，一个真正公平的评估过程应包含关于表现的清晰可记录的数据 —— 但他们却无法提供支持他们所言不公的直接证据。他们认为，不应该仅凭与实际表现无关的推断来评价一个人 —— 但他们正是以这种方式评价管理层。他们坚持要求管理层定义清晰、客观且明确的绩效标准 —— 但又认为任何体贴的系统都应该考虑到专业人士的表现无法被精确测量。最终，他们自诩为学习的支持者 —— 但他们从未提出如何评估一个人是否有学习困难的标准。

In short, the professionals seemed to hold management to a different level of performance than they held themselves. In their conversation at the meetings, they used many of the features of ineffective evaluation that they condemned—the absence of concrete data, for example, and the dependence on a circular logic of “heads we win, tails you lose.” It is as if they were saying, “Here are the features of a fair performance-evaluation system. You should abide by them. But we don’t have to when we are evaluating you.”
Indeed, if we were to explain the professionals’ behavior by articulating rules that would have to be in their heads in order for them to act the way they did, the rules would look something like this:

1. When criticizing the company, state your criticism in ways that you believe are valid—but also in ways that prevent others from deciding for themselves whether your claim to validity is correct.

2. When asked to illustrate your criticisms, don’t include any data that others could use to decide for themselves whether the illustrations are valid.

3. State your conclusions in ways that disguise their logical implications. If others point out those implications to you, deny them.

Of course, when such rules were described to the professionals, they found them abhorrent. It was inconceivable that these rules might explain their actions. And yet in defending themselves against this observation, they almost always inadvertently confirmed the rules.

总的来说，这些专业人士对管理层的要求似乎比对自己的要求要严格。在会议上的讨论中，他们经常使用那些他们自己所批评的评估方法，例如缺乏具体的数据支撑，以及依赖于「不论结果如何都对自己有利」的逻辑。他们的态度仿佛是在说：「这些是公正的绩效评估应有的特征。你们应该遵循这些特征。但当我们来评估你们时，我们则无需这么做。」

实际上，如果我们要通过阐述一些规则来解释这些专业人士的行为，这些规则可能是这样的：

1. 在批评公司时，用你认为有效的方式提出批评 —— 同时也用一种方式来表述，这种方式会阻止别人独立判断你的批评是否站得住脚。

2. 当被要求举例说明你的批评时，不要提供任何他人可以用来自行验证这些例证是否合理的数据。

在表达你的结论时，要掩饰其逻辑后果。如果有人指出这些后果，就予以否认。

当然，当这些规则向专业人士描述时，他们对此表示厌恶。这些规则可能解释他们的行为，对他们来说简直难以置信。然而，在他们试图辩护以回避这种观点的过程中，他们往往不经意间证实了这些规则。

### 03. Learning How to Reason Productively

If defensive reasoning is as widespread as I believe, then focusing on an individual’s attitudes or commitment is never enough to produce real change. And as the previous example illustrates, neither is creating new organizational structures or systems. The problem is that even when people are genuinely committed to improving their performance and management has changed its structures in order to encourage the “right” kind of behavior, people still remain locked in defensive reasoning. Either they remain unaware of this fact, or if they do become aware of it, they blame others.

There is, however, reason to believe that organizations can break out of this vicious circle. Despite the strength of defensive reasoning, people genuinely strive to produce what they intend. They value acting competently. Their self-esteem is intimately tied up with behaving consistently and performing effectively. Companies can use these universal human tendencies to teach people how to reason in a new way—in effect, to change the master programs in their heads and thus reshape their behavior.

People can be taught how to recognize the reasoning they use when they design and implement their actions. They can begin to identify the inconsistencies between their espoused and actual theories of action. They can face up to the fact that they unconsciously design and implement actions that they do not intend. Finally, people can learn how to identify what individuals and groups do to create organizational defenses and how these defenses contribute to an organization’s problems.

Once companies embark on this learning process, they will discover that the kind of reasoning necessary to reduce and overcome organizational defenses is the same kind of “tough reasoning” that underlies the effective use of ideas in strategy, finance, marketing, manufacturing, and other management disciplines. Any sophisticated strategic analysis, for example, depends on collecting valid data, analyzing it carefully, and constantly testing the inferences drawn from the data. The toughest tests are reserved for the conclusions. Good strategists make sure that their conclusions can withstand all kinds of critical questioning.




So too with productive reasoning about human behavior. The standard of analysis is just as high. Human resource programs no longer need to be based on “soft” reasoning but should be as analytical and as data-driven as any other management discipline.

Of course, that is not the kind of reasoning the consultants used when they encountered problems that were embarrassing or threatening. The data they collected was hardly objective. The inferences they made rarely became explicit. The conclusions they reached were largely self-serving, impossible for others to test, and as a result, “self-sealing,” impervious to change.

How can an organization begin to turn this situation around, to teach its members how to reason productively? The first step is for managers at the top to examine critically and change their own theories-in-use. Until senior managers become aware of how they reason defensively and the counterproductive consequences that result, there will be little real progress. Any change activity is likely to be just a fad.

Until senior managers become aware of the ways they reason defensively, any change activity is likely to be just a fad.

Change has to start at the top because otherwise defensive senior managers are likely to disown any transformation in reasoning patterns coming from below. If professionals or middle managers begin to change the way they reason and act, such changes are likely to appear strange—if not actually dangerous—to those at the top. The result is an unstable situation where senior managers still believe that it is a sign of caring and sensitivity to bypass and cover up difficult issues, while their subordinates see the very same actions as defensive.




The key to any educational experience designed to teach senior managers how to reason productively is to connect the program to real business problems. The best demonstration of the usefulness of productive reasoning is for busy managers to see how it can make a direct difference in their own performance and in that of the organization. This will not happen overnight. Managers need plenty of opportunity to practice the new skills. But once they grasp the powerful impact that productive reasoning can have on actual performance, they will have a strong incentive to reason productively not just in a training session but in all their work relationships.

One simple approach I have used to get this process started is to have participants produce a kind of rudimentary case study. The subject is a real business problem that the manager either wants to deal with or has tried unsuccessfully to address in the past. Writing the actual case usually takes less than an hour. But then the case becomes the focal point of an extended analysis.

For example, a CEO at a large organizational-development consulting company was preoccupied with the problems caused by the intense competition among the various business functions represented by his four direct reports. Not only was he tired of having the problems dumped in his lap, but he was also worried about the impact the interfunctional conflicts were having on the organization’s flexibility. He had even calculated that the money being spent to iron out disagreements amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. And the more fights there were, the more defensive people became, which only increased the costs to the organization.

In a paragraph or so, the CEO described a meeting he intended to have with his direct reports to address the problem. Next, he divided the paper in half, and on the right-hand side of the page, he wrote a scenario for the meeting—much like the script for a movie or play—describing what he would say and how his subordinates would likely respond. On the left-hand side of the page, he wrote down any thoughts and feelings that he would be likely to have during the meeting but that he wouldn’t express for fear they would derail the discussion.




But instead of holding the meeting, the CEO analyzed this scenario with his direct reports. The case became the catalyst for a discussion in which the CEO learned several things about the way he acted with his management team.

He discovered that his four direct reports often perceived his conversations as counterproductive. In the guise of being “diplomatic,” he would pretend that a consensus about the problem existed, when in fact none existed. The unintended result: instead of feeling reassured, his subordinates felt wary and tried to figure out “what is he really getting at.”

The CEO also realized that the way he dealt with the competitiveness among department heads was completely contradictory. On the one hand, he kept urging them to “think of the organization as a whole.” On the other, he kept calling for actions—department budget cuts, for example—that placed them directly in competition with each other.

Finally, the CEO discovered that many of the tacit evaluations and attributions he had listed turned out to be wrong. Since he had never expressed these assumptions, he had never found out just how wrong they were. What’s more, he learned that much of what he thought he was hiding came through to his subordinates anyway—but with the added message that the boss was covering up.

The CEO’s colleagues also learned about their own ineffective behavior. They learned by examining their own behavior as they tried to help the CEO analyze his case. They also learned by writing and analyzing cases of their own. They began to see that they too tended to bypass and cover up the real issues and that the CEO was often aware of it but did not say so. They too made inaccurate attributions and evaluations that they did not express. Moreover, the belief that they had to hide important ideas and feelings from the CEO and from each other in order not to upset anyone turned out to be mistaken. In the context of the case discussions, the entire senior management team was quite willing to discuss what had always been undiscussable.

In effect, the case study exercise legitimizes talking about issues that people have never been able to address before. Such a discussion can be emotional—even painful. But for managers with the courage to persist, the payoff is great: management teams and entire organizations work more openly and more effectively and have greater options for behaving flexibly and adapting to particular situations.




Learning to reason productively can be emotional—even painful. But the payoff is great.

When senior managers are trained in new reasoning skills, they can have a big impact on the performance of the entire organization—even when other employees are still reasoning defensively. The CEO who led the meetings on the performance-evaluation procedure was able to defuse dissatisfaction because he didn’t respond to professionals’ criticisms in kind but instead gave a clear presentation of relevant data. Indeed, most participants took the CEO’s behavior to be a sign that the company really acted on the values of participation and employee involvement that it espoused.
Of course, the ideal is for all the members of an organization to learn how to reason productively. This has happened at the company where the case team meeting took place. Consultants and their managers are now able to confront some of the most difficult issues of the consultant-client relationship. To get a sense of the difference productive reasoning can make, imagine how the original conversation between the manager and case team might have gone had everyone engaged in effective reasoning. (The following dialogue is based on actual sessions I have attended with other case teams at the same company since the training has been completed.)

First, the consultants would have demonstrated their commitment to continuous improvement by being willing to examine their own role in the difficulties that arose during the consulting project. No doubt they would have identified their managers and the clients as part of the problem, but they would have gone on to admit that they had contributed to it as well. More important, they would have agreed with the manager that as they explored the various roles of clients, managers, and professionals, they would make sure to test any evaluations or attributions they might make against the data. Each individual would have encouraged the others to question his or her reasoning. Indeed, they would have insisted on it. And in turn, everyone would have understood that act of questioning not as a sign of mistrust or an invasion of privacy but as a valuable opportunity for learning.





To question someone else’s reasoning is not a sign of mistrust but a valuable opportunity for learning.

The conversation about the manager’s unwillingness to say no might look something like this:

Professional #1: “One of the biggest problems I had with the way you managed this case was that you seemed to be unable to say no when either the client or your superior made unfair demands.” [Gives an example.]

Professional #2: “I have another example to add. [Describes a second example.] But I’d also like to say that we never really told you how we felt about this. Behind your back we were bad-mouthing you—you know, ‘he’s being such a wimp’—but we never came right out and said it.”

Manager: “It certainly would have been helpful if you had said something. Was there anything I said or did that gave you the idea that you had better not raise this with me?”

Professional #3: “Not really. I think we didn’t want to sound like we were whining.”

Manager: “Well, I certainly don’t think you sound like you’re whining. But two thoughts come to mind. If I understand you correctly, you were complaining, but the complaining about me and my inability to say no was covered up. Second, if we had discussed this, I might have gotten the data I needed to be able to say no.”
Notice that when the second professional describes how the consultants had covered up their complaints, the manager doesn’t criticize her. Rather, he rewards her for being open by responding in kind. He focuses on the ways that he too may have contributed to the cover-up. Reflecting undefensively about his own role in the problem then makes it possible for the professionals to talk about their fears of appearing to be whining. The manager then agrees with the professionals that they shouldn’t become complainers. At the same time, he points out the counterproductive consequences of covering up their complaints.

Another unresolved issue in the case team meeting concerned the supposed arrogance of the clients. A more productive conversation about that problem might go like this:

Manager: “You said that the clients were arrogant and uncooperative. What did they say and do?”

Professional #1: “One asked me if I had ever met a payroll. Another asked how long I’ve been out of school.”

Professional #2: “One even asked me how old I was!”

Professional #3: “That’s nothing. The worst is when they say that all we do is interview people, write a report based on what they tell us, and then collect our fees.”

Manager: “The fact that we tend to be so young is a real problem for many of our clients. They get very defensive about it. But I’d like to explore whether there is a way for them to freely express their views without our getting defensive…”

“What troubled me about your original responses was that you assumed you were right in calling the clients stupid. One thing I’ve noticed about consultants—in this company and others—is that we tend to defend ourselves by bad-mouthing the client.”
Professional #1: “Right. After all, if they are genuinely stupid, then it’s obviously not our fault that they aren’t getting it!”

Professional #2: “Of course, that stance is antilearning and overprotective. By assuming that they can’t learn, we absolve ourselves from having to.”

Professional #3: “And the more we all go along with the bad-mouthing, the more we reinforce each other’s defensiveness.”

Manager: “So what’s the alternative? How can we encourage our clients to express their defensiveness and at the same time constructively build on it?”

Professional #1: “We all know that the real issue isn’t our age; it’s whether or not we are able to add value to the client’s organization. They should judge us by what we produce. And if we aren’t adding value, they should get rid of us—no matter how young or old we happen to be.”

Manager: “Perhaps that is exactly what we should tell them.”

In both these examples, the consultants and their manager are doing real work. They are learning about their own group dynamics and addressing some generic problems in client-consultant relationships. The insights they gain will allow them to act more effectively in the future—both as individuals and as a team. They are not just solving problems but developing a far deeper and more textured understanding of their role as members of the organization. They are laying the groundwork for continuous improvement that is truly continuous. They are learning how to learn.
