### Abstract

Our aim in this article is to attempt to discuss propagating organization of process, a poorly articulated union of matter, energy, work, constraints and that vexed concept, "information", which unite in far from equilibrium living physical systems. Our hope is to stimulate discussions by philosophers of biology and biologists to further clarify the concepts we discuss here. We place our discussion in the broad context of a "general biology", properties that might well be found in life anywhere in the cosmos, freed from the specific examples of terrestrial life after 3.8 billion years of evolution. By placing the discussion in this wider, if still hypothetical, context, we also try to place in context some of the extant discussion of information as intimately related to DNA, RNA and protein transcription and translation processes. While characteristic of current terrestrial life, there are no compelling grounds to suppose the same mechanisms would be involved in any life form able to evolve by heritable variation and natural selection. In turn, this allows us to discuss at least briefly, the focus of much of the philosophy of biology on population genetics, which, of course, assumes DNA, RNA, proteins, and other features of terrestrial life. Presumably, evolution by natural selection—and perhaps self-organization—could occur on many worlds via different causal mechanisms. Here we seek a non-reductionist explanation for the synthesis, accumulation, and propagation of information, work, and constraint, which we hope will provide some insight into both the biotic and abiotic universe, in terms of both molecular self reproduction and the basic work energy cycle where work is the constrained release of energy into a few degrees of freedom. The typical requirement for work itself is to construct those very constraints on the release of energy that then constitute further work. Information creation, we argue, arises in two ways: first information as natural selection assembling the very constraints on the release of energy that then constitutes work and the propagation of organization. Second, information in a more extended sense is "semiotic", that is about the world or internal state of the organism and requires appropriate response. The idea is to combine ideas from biology, physics, and computer science, to formulate explanatory hypotheses on how information can be captured and rendered in the expected physical manifestation, which can then participate in the propagation of the organization of process in the expected biological work cycles to create the diversity in our observable biosphere. Our conclusions, to date, of this enquiry suggest a foundation which views information as the construction of constraints, which, in their physical manifestation, partially underlie the processes of evolution to dynamically determine the fitness of organisms within the context of a biotic universe.

An organized being is then not a mere machine, for that has merely moving power, but it possesses in itself formative power of a self-propagating kind which it communicates to its materials though they have it not of themselves; it organizes them, in fact, and this cannot explained by the mere mechanical faculty of motion.

我们的目标是尝试在本文中讨论过程的组织传播，这是一种物质、能量、做功、约束和那个令人困惑的概念 ——「信息」的不明确结合，它们在远离平衡的生命物理系统中结合在一起。我们希望通过此举能激发生物学的哲学家和生物学家的讨论，以进一步澄清我们在此讨论的概念。我们将讨论置于「广义生物学」的背景下，这些特性可能在宇宙中的任何生命中存在，脱离了地球生命经过 38 亿年进化的具体例子。通过将讨论置于这个更广泛的背景中（尽管仍然是假设的），我们还尝试将现有的一些关于信息与 DNA、RNA 和蛋白质转录和翻译过程密切相关的讨论放在背景中。虽然这些是当前地球生命的特征，但没有令人信服的理由认为任何能够通过遗传变异和自然选择进化的生命形式都会采用相同的机制。反过来，这使我们至少可以简要讨论生物学哲学的许多焦点，即种群遗传学，这当然假设了 DNA、RNA、蛋白质和其他地球生命的特征。推测自然选择的进化 —— 或许还有自组织 —— 可能通过不同的因果机制在许多世界中发生。在这里，我们寻求一种非还原主义的解释，阐明信息、做功和约束的合成、积累和传播。我们希望这能提供一些关于生物和非生物宇宙的见解，无论是分子自我复制还是基本的做功能量循环，其中做功是能量释放到几个自由度中的受约束释放。做功的典型要求是构建那些对能量释放的约束，这些约束构成了进一步的做功。我们认为，信息的创造有两种方式：首先，信息作为自然选择组装能量释放的约束，然后构成做功和组织的传播。其次，更广泛意义上的信息是「符号学意义的」，即关于生物体的世界或内部状态，并需要适当的响应。这个想法是将生物学、物理学和计算机科学的思想结合起来，形成解释性假设，说明信息如何能够被捕获并呈现为预期的物理表现，然后参与到预期的生物做功循环中的过程组织的传播，以创造我们可观察的生物圈的多样性。迄今为止，我们的研究结论表明，信息被视为约束的构建，在其物理表现中，部分地支撑了进化过程中在生物宇宙背景下动态确定生物体适应性的过程。

有组织的生命体并不是简单的机器，因为机器只有运动能力，而生命体拥有一种能够自我传播的形成能力。这种能力可以传递给物质，尽管物质本身并不具备这种能力；它将物质组织起来，这不能仅仅通过机械运动来解释。

Immanuel Kant – 判断力批判

### 01. Introduction

Our broad aim is to understand propagating organization as exemplified by the vast organization of the co-evolving biosphere. Our effort is a rather mysterious undertaking, for we entirely lack a theory of organization of process, yet the biosphere, from the inception of life to today manifestly propagates organization of process. Indeed, we believe that the evolving universe as a whole also manifests the propagation of organization. We shall focus most of our efforts on the biotic case, but undertake an initial extension of our analysis to the abiotic case as well.

The role of information in biology, what it "is," how it accumulates, and how it is "used," has been directly addressed by mainstream biologists and philosophers of biology. By and large, the biological concept of information derives from the DNA, RNA, protein processes of "coding", transcription, and translation. Yet in the broader sense that we seek to articulate, information in terrestrial life is likely to be one of the key unifying concepts in the emerging field of systems biology. As part of the propagating organization within living cells, the cell operates as an informationprocessing unit, receiving information from its environment, propagating that information through complex molecular networks, and using the information stored in its DNA and cell-molecular systems to mount the appropriate response. Indeed, biology is acquiring many characteristics of an information science (Hood and Galas 2003).

It is sometimes the case that science progresses by finding the concepts and language to "see that which is directly in front of us." Such is the case with the present enquiry. We are persuaded that we are not wholly successful, but hope that we shall have at least started a far broader discussion.

Two predecessors to this article can be found in Investigations (Kauffman 2000), and "Emergence, Autonomous Agents, and Organization" (Kauffman and Clayton 2006). At its core, Investigations seeks to understand the physical nature of agency itself, and proposes that a molecular autonomous agent, able to act on its own behalf in an environment, is an autocatalytic system carrying out at least one thermodynamic work cycle. Much follows from this tentative definition, which implies that an autonomous agent is an open non-equilibrium chemical system, and finds general biotic importance in the fact that work cycles link spontaneous and non-spontaneous (exergonic and endergonic) processes. This linkage has built up the enormous complexity of the biosphere.

Further analysis reveals this work to be the constrained release of energy into a few degrees of freedom. But if one asks where the constraints themselves come from—as in the example of a cylinder and piston that confine the expansion of the working gas in the head of the cylinder to yield the translational motion of the piston, hence the release of energy into a few degrees of freedom—one finds that it typically takes work to construct the constraints.1 

Thus we arrive at the first surprise—it takes constraints on the release of energy for work to happen, but work for the constraints themselves to come into existence. This circle of work and constraint shall turn out to be part of the theory of propagating organization that we shall discuss.

Most importantly, contemporary cells are both collectively autocatalytic and do work cycles, in part to construct constraints on the release of energy. When released, this energy constitutes further work that drives non-spontaneous processes, builds structures, drives processes, and also builds further constraints on the release of energy, which when released can build still more such constraints. In short, cells carry out propagating work linking spontaneous processes, constraints, work, and non-spontaneous processes, and more broadly as we shall see, the propagating organization of process. In doing so, the cell carries out a set of interlocked tasks that achieve a closure of tasks whereby the cell literally builds a rough copy of itself. We know this, yet we have no clear way to say what we know. This closure of work, constraints, tasks, and information, as we shall see below, is a new state of matter, energy, information, and organization that constitutes the living state.

The new insight that we explore in this article is that the constraints that allow autonomous agents to channel free energy into work are connected to information: in fact, simply put, the constraints are the information, are partially causal in the diversity of what occurs in cells, and are part of the organization that is propagated.

[1] Here we use the word "constraint" in a very general sense that includes "global constraints" (e.g. conservation of energy, symmetry conditions etc.,) and "local constraints" or boundary conditions (e.g. initial conditions, reflection or absorption at a spatial location). 

In "Emergence, Autonomous Agents, and Organization" (Kauffman and Clayton 2006), the tentative definition of autonomous agent is extended to include construction of boundaries enclosing the agent, discrimination of "yuck" (meaning poison) or "yum" (meaning food), and at least one choice of action: flee (or not), approach (or not). Our language is teleological. We believe that autonomous agents constitute the minimal physical system to which teleological language rightly applies.

It is important that our definition of a molecular autonomous agent applies to terrestrial life, but is, in principle far broader. The concepts identify a new class of far from equilibrium chemical thermodynamic systems, and we suspect, could form the basis of life in a variety of molecular instantiations. For example, already Sievers and von Kiedrowski (1994) and Lee et al. (1997a, b), have made collectively selfreproducing DNA and peptide systems. Quite directly, Lee et al. (ibid.) have shown that self-reproduction does not depend upon the double helix structure of DNA and RNA. Thus self-reproduction on a basis other than template replication, transcription and translation has been achieved. Further, work on the origin of life based on self reproducing liposomes (Mavelli and Luisi 1996), the theory of the probable emergence of collectively autocatalytic sets of molecules (Kauffman 1993), and autocatalysis in organic reaction mixtures (Smith and Morowitz 2004), begins to suggest a broad physical basis for life in the cosmos. Molecular autonomous agents have yet to be created, but work cycles and molecular motors are accomplished experimental facts.

If we succeed in creating, or finding life which is radically different from contemporary earth life, the way will open up for a general biology, and a new union of physics, chemistry, biology, and the information sciences. Core to this, we feel, will be an understanding of propagating organization of process.

We comment that it is unlikely that very early life was based on DNA, RNA and proteins via transcription and translation, given the huge complexity of the molecular apparatus to achieve these events, including encoded enzymes that charge transfer RNA with the correct amino acids to achieve translation. We emphasize this, because we wish to place a discussion of information, and its relation to work, constraint, and propagating organization in a wider context that the contemporary debate among philosophers of biology and biologists about the information status of the DNA fi RNA fi protein chain.

In turn, a general biology will necessarily confront us with a discussion of evolution by heritable variation and natural selection, perhaps typically without the familiar concepts of DNA, gene frequencies, alterations of gene frequencies as the microevents of microevolution and the diverse philosophic opinions that have ranged over these issues. We will have to explore the general conditions allowing for evolution and the emergence of biospheres.

This article is organized as follows:

In the "Darwinian adaptations and preadaptations" section we discuss Darwinian adaptations and preadaptations, argue that the first implies that biology cannot be reduced to physics, while the second, stunningly, implies that the future evolution of the biosphere cannot be finitely prestated. Much follows from these surprising conclusions.

In the "Shannon information" section we discuss Shannon information and argue that it does not apply to the evolution of the biosphere. One reason is that due to Darwinian preadaptations, the ensemble of possibilities and their entropy cannot be calculated.

In the "Schro¨dinger's aperiodic crystal..." section we begin with Schro¨dinger's famous statement that a periodic crystal cannot "say" a lot, while an aperiodic crystal can say a lot, and will contain a microcode. We shall argue that the proper and deep understanding of Schro¨dinger's intuition is that an aperiodic crystal contains a very large number of diverse constraints that are partially causal in guiding the huge diversity of specific events and processes which occur physically in cells. From this we shall arrive at a new formulation: constraints are information and information is constraints. The first part of this twosome, constraints are information is, we believe, secure. The second part, information is constraints, may be more problematic.

In "The relativity of information" section we discuss the relativity of the concept of information.

In the "Semiosis as a special case..." section we shall place our definition of biotic information in the larger context in which information is "about" something, arguing that when an autonomous agent discriminates yuck or yum, the molecular signatures of yuck or yum are about yuck or yum, hence the rudiment of semiotics.

We shall locate biotic (but not linguistic) semiosis, as a subcase of information as constraints.

In the "Heritable variation and natural..." section we shall stress that constraints as information, and, derivatively, semiotic information, must have causal consequences for the autonomous agent. These consequences increase its fitness such that the information is assembled by natural selection into the ongoing evolution of the biosphere. Without this coupling to fitness, the information and its effects would not come to exist in the universe. Therefore we shall argue that natural selection constitutes the assembly machinery, when coupled with heritable variation, that literally assembles the propagating organization of matter, energy, constraint, work, and information. This constitutes the propagating organization in autonomous agents, whose co-evolution drives the biosphere's progressive exploration of what we call the Adjacent Possible. This discussion is reminiscent of some aspects of Maynard Smith's argument (2000a, b) that selection confers on genes a specific informational character, and Sterelny and Griffiths (1999) broadened concept that selection confers on many features of a cell or organism the features of information.

In "The evolution of the abiotic..." section we attempt to extend our analysis to the abiotic universe. We find that our analysis that considers information as constraints is equivalent to the statement that information consists in boundary conditions and in global constraints. But, in classical and quantum physics, boundary conditions—like the cylinder and piston—are only partially causal for what occurs.

Physicists often "put in by hand" the boundary conditions of a problem, such as the behavior of the cylinder, piston, and working gas system. But in the unfolding of the biosphere or universe since the Big Bang, the very coming into existence of new boundary conditions—information we argue—is itself part of the full dynamics of the total system. We thus assume a context with information understood as boundary conditions on the release of energy that makes diverse processes happen.

So we argue that in the proper union of matter, energy and information it is precisely the union of matter, energy, and boundary conditions that, in an expanding and cooling universe, progressively break symmetries, invade the Adjacent Possible, and cause an increasing diversity of events, processes and structures to come into existence. The evolution of the biosphere is but one case of this general process.

In the "Population genetics and evolution..." section we briefly discuss the general context of successful evolution by heritable variation and natural selection in a general biology. Here the "neighborhood" relations between different autonomous agents is an issue. More essentially, without propagating organization of process there would be nothing upon which selection could act. Thus, we suggest, the habit of population genetics of ignoring the root physical basis of life may first of all constrain our understanding of evolution unnecessarily to contemporary earth life, and misses entirely what we shall describe as the evolution of perhaps any biosphere into its "Adjacent Possible", a fundamental feature of life that underlies the specifics of evolution by altering gene frequencies.

01 引言

我们的主要目标是理解以共进化的生物圈为代表的传播组织。这个任务相当神秘，因为我们完全缺乏过程组织的理论。然而，从生命的起源到现在，生物圈显然在传播这种过程组织。实际上，我们相信，整个不断进化的宇宙也表现出组织传播。我们将主要集中研究生物案例，但也会初步扩展分析到非生物案例。

信息在生物学中的作用、它的本质、如何积累以及如何使用，已经被主流生物学家和生物学哲学家直接探讨。通常，生物学中的信息概念源于 DNA、RNA、蛋白质的编码、转录和翻译过程。然而，我们试图阐明的更广泛意义上，地球生命中的信息可能是新兴系统生物学中的关键统一概念。细胞作为传播组织的一部分，充当信息处理单元，接收环境信息，通过复杂的分子网络传播信息，并使用存储在 DNA 和细胞分子系统中的信息来做出适当反应。实际上，生物学正在逐渐具备许多信息科学的特点（Hood 和 Galas 2003）。

有时候，科学的进步在于找到概念和语言，去「看清就在我们眼前的事物」。这正是我们当前研究的情况。我们知道我们的研究可能还不够全面，但希望能够引发更广泛的讨论。

这篇文章的两个前身可以在《Investigations》（Kauffman 2000）和《Emergence, Autonomous Agents, and Organization》（Kauffman and Clayton 2006）中找到。Investigations 的核心是试图理解代理的物理本质，并提出了一种分子自主代理的概念，这种代理能够在环境中自主行动，是一个执行至少一个热力学做功循环的自催化系统。这个定义表明自主代理是一种开放的非平衡化学系统，并且由于做功循环将自发和非自发（放能和吸能）过程联系起来，这在生物学上具有重要意义。这种联系构建了生物圈的复杂性。

进一步分析表明，所谓的做功其实是将能量释放到几个自由度中的受限释放。但如果问这些限制条件是从哪里来的 —— 比如气缸和活塞的例子，气缸中的气体膨胀被限制在活塞的平移运动中，从而将能量释放到几个自由度 —— 我们会发现通常需要做功来构建这些限制条件。

因此我们得出了第一个令人惊讶的结论 —— 需要限制条件才能进行能量的释放和做功，但构建这些限制条件本身也需要做功。这个做功和限制条件的循环将成为我们即将讨论的传播组织理论的一部分。

最重要的是，当代细胞不仅能够自发催化，还能进行做功循环，这部分是为了控制能量的释放。当能量释放时，细胞利用这些能量驱动非自发的过程，构建结构，推动各种活动，同时进一步控制能量的释放。这种控制又能在能量释放时构建更多的限制。简而言之，细胞通过一系列做功，将自发过程、限制、做功和非自发过程连接起来，更广泛地说，是连接各种过程的有序组织。通过这些做功，细胞执行一组相互关联的任务，从而实现这些任务的闭环，使细胞能够复制出一个粗略的自身副本。我们知道这一点，但却难以用明确的语言来表达。这种做功、限制、任务和信息的闭合状态，如下所述，是一种新的物质、能量、信息和组织状态，构成了生命状态。

本文探讨的新见解是，允许自主智能体将自由能量转化为做功的限制，与信息是密切相关的：实际上，简单来说，这些限制就是信息，它们部分决定了细胞内发生的多样性，并且是细胞组织的一部分。

[1] 在这里，我们使用「限制」一词的广义定义，包括「全局限制」（例如，能量守恒、对称条件等）和「局部限制」或边界条件（例如，初始条件、空间位置的反射或吸收）。

在《Emergence, Autonomous Agents, and Organization》（Kauffman 和 Clayton 2006）中，自治智能体的定义被扩展为包括构建智能体的边界，区分「yuck」（即毒药）或「yum」（即食物），以及至少一种行动选择：逃跑（或不逃）、接近（或不接近）。我们使用的语言是目的论的。我们认为，自治智能体是最低限度的物理系统，适用于目的论语言。

重要的是，我们对分子自治智能体的定义适用于地球上的生命，但原则上更加广泛。这些概念识别出一种新的远离平衡的化学热力学系统类，我们怀疑，这些概念可以构成各种分子形式中的生命基础。例如，Sievers 和 von Kiedrowski（1994）以及 Lee 等人（1997a, b）已经共同制造了自我复制的 DNA 和肽系统。非常直接地，Lee 等人（同上）已经表明，自我复制不依赖于 DNA 和 RNA 的双螺旋结构。因此，已经实现了在模板复制、转录和翻译之外的自我复制。此外，基于自我复制脂质体的生命起源研究（Mavelli 和 Luisi 1996)，关于集体自催化分子集合可能出现的理论（Kauffman 1993)，以及有机反应混合物中的自催化现象（Smith 和 Morowitz 2004)，都开始暗示生命在宇宙中的广泛物理基础。虽然分子自治智能体尚未被创造，但做功循环和分子马达已经是实验事实。

如果我们成功创造或发现与现有地球生命根本不同的生命，将为普遍生物学以及物理学、化学、生物学和信息科学的新结合打开大门。我们认为，理解过程传播的组织将是其中的核心。

我们认为，早期生命不太可能是通过 DNA、RNA 和蛋白质的转录和翻译过程来实现的，因为这一过程所需的分子机制极其复杂，包括负责将转移 RNA 连接到正确氨基酸的编码酶。我们特别强调这一点，是为了在更广泛的背景下讨论信息及其与做功、约束和传播组织的关系，而不仅仅是当代生物学哲学家和生物学家关于 DNA 到 RNA 再到蛋白质这一链的信息状态的争论。

进一步说，生物学的广泛研究将不可避免地让我们面对关于可遗传变异和自然选择的进化讨论，可能不涉及我们熟悉的 DNA、基因频率及其变化的概念，以及这些问题所引发的各种哲学观点。我们需要探索允许进化和生物圈形成的一般条件。

本文的结构如下：

在「达尔文适应和预适应」部分，我们讨论达尔文适应和预适应，认为前者表明生物学不能简化为物理学，而后者则令人惊讶地表明生物圈的未来进化无法有限地预先确定。这些令人意外的结论有很多值得探讨的地方。

在「香农信息」部分，我们讨论了香农信息，并认为它不适用于生物圈的进化。原因之一是由于达尔文的预适应，可能性的集合及其熵无法计算。

在「薛定谔的非周期晶体」一节中，我们首先引用了薛定谔的著名言论，即周期晶体所能表达的信息有限，而非周期晶体可以包含大量信息，并且会包含一个微码。我们将论证，深刻理解薛定谔的这一直觉，即非周期晶体包含大量多样的约束，这些约束在指导细胞内各种具体事件和过程方面具有部分因果性。由此我们提出一个新观点：约束就是信息，信息就是约束。我们认为，前半部分「约束就是信息」是可靠的，而后半部分「信息就是约束」可能存在争议。

在「信息的相对性」一节中，我们讨论了信息概念的相对性。

在「作为特例的符号学」一节中，我们将在信息「关于」某物的更大背景下定义生物信息，论证当一个自主智能体区分「恶心」或「美味」时，这些「恶心」或「美味」的分子特征反映了相应的感知，因此是符号学的基础。

我们将生物符号学（不包括语言符号学）视作信息作为约束的一个特例。

在「遗传变异和自然...」部分中，我们强调，作为信息的约束以及由此衍生的符号信息，必须对自主智能体产生因果影响。这样的影响提高了智能体的适应性，使得信息通过自然选择被整合到生物圈的持续进化过程中。如果没有这种与适应性的耦合，信息及其效果将不会在宇宙中存在。因此，我们认为自然选择是一个组装机制，当与遗传变异相结合时，它实际上组装了物质、能量、约束、做功和信息的传播结构。这构成了自主智能体的传播组织，其共进化推动了生物圈对「邻近可能性」的渐进探索。这一讨论让人联想到 Maynard Smith 的某些论点（2000a, b)，他认为选择赋予基因特定的信息特征，而 Sterelny 和 Griffiths（1999）扩展了这个概念，认为选择赋予细胞或有机体的许多特征以信息特征。

在「非生物演化...」部分中，我们尝试将分析扩展到非生物宇宙。我们发现，将信息视为约束的分析等同于认为信息由边界条件和全局约束组成。但是，在经典和量子物理中，边界条件（如圆筒和活塞）仅对事件的发生部分具有因果性。

物理学家常常人为设定问题的边界条件，比如圆柱体、活塞和做功气体系统的行为。但是，在生物圈或宇宙自大爆炸以来的发展过程中，新的边界条件的出现 —— 我们认为这是信息 —— 本身就是整个系统动态的一部分。因此，我们假设一个情境，即信息被理解为释放能量的边界条件，从而使得各种过程得以发生。

因此，我们认为，在物质、能量和信息的适当结合中，正是物质、能量和边界条件的结合，在一个不断扩展和冷却的宇宙中，逐渐打破对称性，探索邻近的可能性，并导致越来越多的事件、过程和结构的出现。生物圈的进化只是这一普遍过程的一个例子。

在「种群遗传学和进化...」部分中，我们简要讨论了通过可遗传变异和自然选择在一般生物学中成功进化的总体背景。在这里，不同自主体之间的「邻近」关系是一个问题。更本质上，如果没有过程的传播和组织，选择就无从作用。因此，我们认为，种群遗传学忽略生命的根本物理基础的做法，可能会不必要地将我们对进化的理解限制在当代地球生命上，并完全忽略了我们将描述的任何生物圈向其「邻近可能性」进化的过程，这是生命的一种基本特征，而这种特征又是改变基因频率的进化具体特征所依赖的。

### 02. Darwinian Adaptations and Preadaptations

Were one to have asked Darwin what the function of the heart is, he would presumably have responded that the function of the heart is to pump blood. But the heart has a wealth of other causal consequences, such as heart sounds. Heart sounds are not the function of the heart. That is, the causal consequence of the heart that matters, the virtue for which it was selected, was the pumping of blood.

So the function of a part (or organ) of an organism is typically, if not always, a subset of its causal consequences. This has major implications. Among these, the function of a part (or organ) of an organism cannot be analyzed except in the context of the whole organism in its selective environment. But further, this fact is just one of the reasons that biology cannot be reduced to physics. In Kauffman and Clayton (2006), it is argued that, if we grant the physicist a theory of everything, say string theory to cite one example, and the capacity to deduce upwards to all that occurs in the universe—an impossibility given throws of the quantum dice—the physicist could deduce all the causal features of the heart, but would have no way to pick out the pumping of blood as the relevant causal property which is the function of the heart and which is the property that gave rise to the evolutionary emergence of this organ.

To do so, the physicist would have to discuss whole organisms as causal agents in their own right, evolving under natural selection in changing environments. That is, the physicist would have to become a biologist and talk biology talk. Thus, biology cannot be reduced to physics, rather physics has to be lifted up to biology.

A second reason we feel biology is emergent with respect to physics is that Darwin's natural selection is utterly neutral with respect to the physical basis of heritable variation and hence natural selection. Life might be based on DNA, RNA and proteins, or might be based on autocatalytic organic chemical reactions systems, and/or polymer systems that create a bounding membrane. This implies that a physicist armed with a theory of everything might, (actually could not) deduce that a specific molecular autonomous agent would have offspring of differential reproductive success, the physicist cannot deduce Darwin's natural selection itself which transcends any specific realization of it. Indeed, for small changes in the constants of nature, life might still be possible, hence Darwin's "higher order" or emergent law cannot even be reduced to the physics of this universe.

In short, for these and other reasons, we wish to join forces with those who argue for a limitation of reductionism, and the reality of emergence with respect to the furniture of the universe (Silberstein 2003).

Darwin had many brilliant insights. Among these is what is now called a Darwinian preadaptation. Here the central concept is that a causal property of a part of an organism that is not of selective significance in the normal environment might become useful in a different environment, and hence become subject to selection. It is critical to point out, first that Darwinian preadaptations have occurred repeatedly in evolution, and second, that such an evolutionary step results in the emergence in the biosphere of a novel function. For example, lungs evolved from the swim bladders of certain early fish. The swim bladders, partially filled with water and partially with air, adjusted the height in the water column to establish neutral buoyancy of the fish. But the swim bladder, with air in it, was preadapted for use as a lung, and air breathing was a novel functionality with its own causal consequences that allowed life to conquer land thereby changing the universe.

We now raise a central question discussed in Investigations. Is it possible to say ahead of time what all possible Darwinian preadaptations are for human beings, or for the whole biota of the contemporary biosphere for that matter? The answer appears to be "No." We cannot finitely prestate all possible Darwinian preadaptations. Part of the difficulty, or impossibility, in doing so is that we cannot even begin the task of prestating what all possible selective environments will be. That is, there appears to be no finitely stateable procedure which would allow us to enumerate all possible selective environments.

Part of the challenge is that the concept of such environments is systematically vague. It is not even clear how to begin on the project of listing all possible environments for all actual, let alone possible, organisms. While we do not know how to prove our claim, we believe it to be true and shall assume that it is.

We point out that the property or causal consequence which becomes the subject of a Darwinian preadaptation need not be a mutant property. It might be a normal feature of the organism, but normally of no selective significance until the new environment is encountered. Therefore, an attempt to enumerate the possible preadaptations by trying to count the number of mutations possible to a genome is irrelevant. Darwinian preadaptations cannot, in general, be prestated.

Much follows from the claim that we cannot finitely prestate all possible Darwinian preadaptations of all contemporary organisms. First, it means in a radical sense that we cannot predict the future evolution of the biosphere. We literally have no idea of what such preadaptations may be. Second, it means that a frequency interpretation of probability statements does not apply to possible probability statements about the evolution of the biosphere. In the normal frequency interpretation of probability, say that a fair coin will be heads about 5,000 times out of 10,000 coin flips, one can finitely prestate all possible outcomes. This is not possible for the evolving biosphere. Third, and dramatically, the incapacity to say ahead of time what the relevant preadaptations will be means that we cannot write down a stateable set of variables in equations whose dynamics captures the evolution of the biosphere. But all our mathematical techniques in physics begin with a prestatement of the full set of variables and the configuration space of the system. This is true in Newtonian dynamics, statistical mechanics, general relativity and in quantum mechanics if one does not believe in hidden variables. If one believes in hidden variables then because they are hidden they cannot be prestated hence the caveat for quantum mechanics.

But we cannot prestate the configuration space of the biosphere. Now a classical physicist might argue that, if we take the solar system, it is just a large classical 3N dimensional system where N is the number of particles in the solar system and the current biosphere within the rest of the solar system is a point in that space. Let us grant the move. Then, we rejoin, the physicist has no way to pick out the collective variables, the lungs and hearts and wings, and features of the environment that are the relevant causal variables for the ongoing evolution of the biosphere. Thus, again we see that we cannot write down causal laws with a prestated set of (collective) variables for the evolution of the biosphere.

We shall not discuss it further here, but the same incapacity to prestate the evolution of the economy and its technology also arises, as does the incapacity to prestate the evolution of human culture. But all this has the deepest implications.

Reductionist science is powerful, but is limited. This sets us free in astonishing ways, for organisms live their lives forward, they do not deduce them. We appear to live in a universe in which our reductionistic world view is inadequate: there is the emergence of life, and value as we discuss below. Human language and culture also represent propagating organization (Logan 2006, 2007). Moreover we live in and partially co-create a ceaselessly "creative" biosphere, economy, and human culture.

This glimmers a new scientific world view, beyond reductionism with broad potential societal ramifications (Kauffman 2006).

如果有人问达尔文，心脏的功能是什么，他很可能会回答心脏的功能是泵血。然而，心脏还有其他许多因果结果，比如心音。心音并不是心脏的功能。换句话说，心脏的主要因果结果，即它被自然选择的原因，是泵血。

因此，一个有机体的部分（或器官）的功能通常是其因果结果的一部分。这有着重要的意义。其中之一是，有机体的部分（或器官）的功能必须在整个有机体及其所处的选择环境中进行分析。此外，这也是生物学不能简化为物理学的原因之一。根据 Kauffman 和 Clayton（2006）的论点，即使我们假设物理学家有一个大一统理论，比如弦理论，并且能够推导出宇宙中的一切 —— 实际上这是不可能的，因为量子的随机性 —— 物理学家可以推导出心脏的所有因果特性，但无法确定泵血是心脏的重要因果特性，也就是这种特性促成了心脏的进化出现。

要做到这一点，物理学家必须把整个有机体视为独立的因果代理，在不断变化的环境中通过自然选择进行进化。也就是说，物理学家必须成为生物学家，用生物学的语言进行讨论。因此，生物学不能简化为物理学，相反，物理学必须提升到生物学。

我们认为生物学相对于物理学具有涌现特性的第二个原因是，达尔文的自然选择对可遗传变异的物理基础完全中立。生命可以基于 DNA、RNA 和蛋白质，也可以基于自催化有机化学反应系统，或者形成边界膜的聚合物系统。这意味着，即使一个物理学家拥有「大一统理论」，他也无法推断出一个特定的分子自主智能体会有不同的生殖成功率，而达尔文的自然选择本身超越了任何具体的实现形式。确实，即使自然常数发生微小变化，生命依然可能存在，因此，达尔文的「高阶」或涌现法则甚至不能被归结为这个宇宙的物理学。

简而言之，出于这些和其他原因，我们希望与那些主张限制还原论和承认宇宙结构涌现现实的人（Silberstein 2003）联合起来。

达尔文有许多卓越的见解。其中之一是现在被称为「达尔文式预适应」(Darwinian preadaptation)。其核心概念是，生物体某部分的因果关系在正常环境中没有选择意义，但在不同的环境中可能变得有用，因此成为选择的对象。首先需要指出的是，达尔文式预适应在进化过程中反复出现；其次，这样一个进化步骤在生物圈中产生了一种新功能。例如，肺是由某些早期鱼类的鳔演化而来的。鳔部分充满水，部分充满空气，通过调整水柱中的高度来维持鱼的中性浮力。但充满空气的鳔被预适应为肺，空气呼吸作为一种新功能，有其独特的因果关系，使生命得以征服陆地，从而改变了生态系统。

我们现在提出一个在《Investigations》一书中讨论的核心问题。是否可以提前预测所有可能的达尔文式预适应，无论是对人类还是当代生物圈的整个生物群？答案似乎是否定的。我们不能有限地预测所有可能的达尔文式预适应。这样做的困难或不可能性的一部分在于，我们甚至无法开始预测所有可能的选择环境。也就是说，似乎没有一个有限的程序可以让我们列举所有可能的选择环境。

挑战的一部分在于，这种环境的概念是系统模糊的。甚至不清楚如何开始列出所有实际的，更不用说可能的生物的所有可能环境。虽然我们不知道如何证明我们的主张，但我们相信它是正确的，并将假设它是正确的。

我们指出，成为达尔文预适应主题的特性或因果结果不一定是突变特性。它可能是有机体的一个正常特征，只是在遇到新环境之前通常没有选择意义。因此，试图通过计算基因组中的可能突变数来列举预适应是没有意义的。一般来说，达尔文预适应是无法预先陈述的。

这一主张带来许多结论。首先，这意味着我们无法预测生物圈的未来演化，因为我们根本不知道可能的预适应是什么。其次，这也意味着频率解释的概率陈述不适用于生物圈演化的概率陈述。在正常的频率解释中，比如说，一个公平硬币在 10000 次掷硬币中大约有 5000 次是正面，这种情况下可以预先陈述所有可能的结果。但对于不断演化的生物圈来说，这种预先陈述是不可能的。第三，更为显著的是，无法提前确定相关预适应意味着我们无法写出一组变量，其动态性可以捕捉到生物圈的演化。然而，我们在物理学中的所有数学技术都是从预先陈述系统的全部变量和配置空间开始的。这在牛顿动力学、统计力学、广义相对论和量子力学中都适用，除非你相信隐藏变量的存在。如果相信隐藏变量，由于它们是隐藏的，因此也无法预先陈述，这就是对量子力学的警告。

但是我们无法预先描述生物圈的配置空间。现在，一位经典物理学家可能会认为，如果我们考虑太阳系，它只是一个大型的经典 3N 维系统，其中 N 是太阳系中的粒子数量，而当前的生物圈在太阳系的其余部分中是该空间中的一个点。假设我们接受这个观点。随后，我们回应说，物理学家无法挑选出集体变量，例如肺、心脏和翅膀，以及环境特征，这些是生物圈持续演化的相关因果变量。因此，我们再次看到，我们无法用一组预先规定的（集体）变量来描述生物圈演化的因果规律。

我们在此不再进一步讨论，但同样地，我们也无法预先描述经济及其技术的演化，甚至人类文化的演化也是如此。但所有这些都有最深远的影响。

还原论科学虽然强大，但也有其局限性。这以一种惊人的方式使我们得以解放，因为生物是向前生活的，它们不会演绎出自己的生活。我们似乎生活在一个我们的还原论世界观不足的宇宙中：正如我们将在下面讨论的，有生命的出现和价值。人类语言和文化也代表了传播的组织（Logan 2006, 2007）。此外，我们生活在一个不断「创造」的生物圈、经济和人类文化中，并部分参与其创造。

这预示着一种超越还原论的新科学世界观，并具有广泛的潜在社会影响（Kauffman 2006）。

### 03. Shannon Information

Shannon (1948) information theory has been a brilliant mathematical construct. At its core, Shannon envisioned a Source with a set of messages, symbol strings, over which a well defined probability distribution might be attributed. Then he envisioned a (perhaps noisy) channel over which information is transmitted. He then envisioned a receiver and, importantly, a decoder. Shannon's move was to calculate the entropy of the set of messages at the Source. The information that propagated down the channel and was received at the receiver removed uncertainty with respect to the entropy of the Source. This reduction of uncertainty, hence the lowering of the entropy of the Source, constitutes the amount of information transmitted. One interpretation, not given by Shannon himself who abjured to say what information "is," is that information is just the reduction in uncertainty at the receiver. This definition leaves open exactly what the claim might mean. It might be the reduction of uncertainty in a human receiver's mind, for example.

Importantly, and widely recognized, is the fact that Shannon information considers the amount of information, nominally in bits, but is devoid of semantics. There is no sense of what information is "about" in Shannon information.

Now we ask whether Shannon information applies to the evolution of the biosphere. We answer that it does not. In particular, Shannon information requires that a prestated probability distribution (frequency interpreted) be well stated concerning the message ensemble, from which its entropy can be computed. But if Darwinian preadaptations cannot be prestated, then the entropy calculation cannot be carried out ahead of time with respect to the distribution of features of organisms in the biosphere. This, we believe, is a sufficient condition to state that Shannon information does not describe the information content in the evolution of the biosphere.

There are further difficulties with Shannon information and the evolving biosphere. What might constitute the "Source"? Start at the origin of life, or the last common ancestor. What is the source of something like "messages" that are being transmitted in the process of evolution from that Source? The answer is entirely unclear. Further, what is the transmission channel? Contemporary terrestrial life is based on DNA, RNA, and proteins via the genetic code. It is insufficient to state that the channel is the transmission of DNA from one generation to the next. Instead, one would have to say that the actual "channel" involves successive life cycles of whole organisms. For sexual organisms this involves the generation of the zygote, the development of the adult from that zygote, the pairing of that adult with a mate, and a further life cycle. Hence, part of one answer to what the "channel" might be is that the fertilized egg is a channel with the Shannon information to yield the subsequent adult. But it has turned out that even if all orientations of all molecules in the zygote were utilized, there is not enough information capacity to store the information to yield the adult. This move was countered by noting that, if anything, development is rather more like an algorithm than an information channel (Apter and Wolpert 1965). In short, a channel to transmit Shannon information along life cycles does not exist, so again, Shannon information does not seem to apply to the biosphere.

It seems central to point out that the evolution of the biosphere is not the transmission of information down some channel from some source, but rather the persistent, ongoing, co-construction, via propagating organization, heritable variation, and natural selection, of the collective biosphere. Propagating organization requires work. It is important to note that Shannon ignored the work requirements to transmit "abstract" information, although it might be argued that the concept of constraints is implicit in the restrictions on the messages at the Source. While we mention this, we have no clear understanding physically of what such constraints are.

One might be tempted to argue that a Shannon-like information theory could be applied to the vast set of selective events that have led to the specific DNA sequences that are in contemporary organisms. But does this move work? Can we specify a finite ensemble of possible DNA sequences out of which the present DNA sequences have been derived? If we consider all DNA sequences longer than, say 1,000 nucleotides, it would take vastly large repetitions of the history of the universe for the universe to construct one copy of each possibility. This cannot physically constitute the ensemble. Is the ensemble the set of DNA sequences that have been explored in the actual evolution of the biosphere, some accepted, most rejected? This approach initially seems promising, but has the obvious difficulty that we cannot specify the ensemble explored in 3.8 billion years, hence do not and cannot know the Shannon information content of the biosphere. A further difficulty with this approach is that it measures the information content of the biosphere as a function of the number of DNA sequences "tried" in evolution. But very different numbers of attempted mutations might have led to the same biosphere, hence quantitating the information of the biosphere by the number of attempted DNA mutations is not in direct correspondence to any specific biosphere.

We conclude that a Shannon Information content analysis of the information content of the evolving biosphere is not legitimate. 

03 香农信息

Shannon（1948）的信息理论是一项辉煌的数学构想。Shannon 设想了一个消息源，这个源包含一组符号串构成的消息，并且这些消息可以归属一个明确的概率分布。他还设想了一个（可能有噪声的）信道，通过这个信道传输信息。接着，他设想了一个接收器以及一个重要的解码器。Shannon 的方法是计算消息源中消息的熵。通过信道传输并在接收器处接收到的信息减少了关于源的熵的不确定性。这种不确定性的减少，也就是源的熵的降低，构成了传输的信息量。虽然 Shannon 自己没有明确说明信息「是什么」，一种解释是信息只是接收器处不确定性的减少。这个定义并没有明确指出具体含义。例如，它可能指的是在人类接收者心中的不确定性减少。

重要且广泛认可的是，香农信息关注的是信息量，通常以比特为单位，但并不涉及信息的语义。香农信息没有讨论信息「关于什么」的含义。

现在我们来探讨香农信息是否适用于生物圈的进化。我们的答案是否定的。具体来说，香农信息要求对消息集合的概率分布进行预先声明（按频率解释），以便计算其熵。但是，如果达尔文的预适应性不能预先声明，那么就无法提前计算生物圈中生物特征分布的熵。我们认为，这足以说明香农信息不能描述生物圈进化中的信息内容。

香农信息理论在解释生物圈的进化过程中遇到了一些困难。首先，什么可以被定义为「源」？是生命的起源，还是最后的共同祖先？在进化过程中，类似于「信息」的东西是从哪里传递出来的？这个问题目前还没有明确的答案。

其次，传输通道是什么呢？我们知道，当代地球上的生命是通过遗传密码中的 DNA、RNA 和蛋白质进行信息传递的。但仅仅说 DNA 从一代传递到下一代作为通道是不够的。实际上，整个生物体的连续生命周期才是实际的「通道」。对于有性生殖的生物，这个过程包括受精卵的形成、受精卵发育成成体、成体与配偶的配对及其后续的生命周期。

因此，可以说，受精卵是作为通道，携带着产生后续成体的香农信息。然而，研究发现，即使利用受精卵中所有分子的所有取向，信息容量仍不足以存储生成成体所需的全部信息。有人指出，发育过程更像是一个算法，而不是一个信息通道（Apter 和 Wolpert 1965)。

总之，在生命周期中传输香农信息的通道并不存在，因此，香农信息理论似乎并不适用于解释生物圈。

似乎有必要指出，生物圈的进化并不是通过某个渠道从某个源头传递信息，而是通过传播组织、可遗传变异和自然选择的方式，持续进行的共同构建。传播组织需要耗费能量。需要注意的是，Shannon 忽略了传输「抽象」信息所需的能量，尽管可以说约束的概念在源头消息的限制中是隐含的。尽管我们提到这一点，但我们对这种约束在物理上究竟是什么并没有明确的理解。

有人可能会主张，香农信息理论可以应用于导致当代生物体中特定 DNA 序列的大量选择事件。但这种方法是否有效呢？我们能否指定一个有限的可能 DNA 序列集，从中推导出现有的 DNA 序列？如果我们考虑所有长度超过 1,000 个核苷酸的 DNA 序列，宇宙需要重复极多次才能构建每种可能性的一个副本。这在物理上是不可能的。集合是否是实际进化过程中探索过的 DNA 序列集，其中一些被接受，大多数被拒绝？这种方法乍看起来很有前途，但明显的困难在于我们无法指定在 38 亿年中探索的集合，因此无法知道生物圈的香农信息内容。此方法的另一个困难在于，它将生物圈的信息内容衡量为进化过程中尝试过的 DNA 序列的数量。但非常不同数量的尝试突变可能导致相同的生物圈，因此通过尝试的 DNA 突变数量来量化生物圈的信息与任何特定生物圈不直接对应。

我们得出结论，使用香农信息理论分析进化生物圈的信息内容是不恰当的。

### 04. Schro¨dinger's aperiodic crystal

Schro¨dinger's aperiodic crystal: "instructional" information as constraint or boundary condition

In What is Life, Schro¨dinger (1992) is concerned with the order in organisms and hence the physical basis of the gene. He argues, based on X-ray mutation induction frequency, that the gene must have a few hundred to a few thousand atoms, and points out that statistical mechanical equilibria cannot account for the stability of the organism over generations. He then posits that quantum mechanics in the form of chemical bonds is the answer. Then he brilliantly points out that the order of life cannot be based on a periodic crystal, for such a crystal cannot say a lot, or carry much information. He places his bet on aperiodic crystals which can, in strong contrast, say a lot, or carry much information, even a microcode which will somehow specify the adult.

He was brilliantly right, and presaged DNA and the genetic code. Now we come to the critical issue. In just what sense can an aperiodic crystal "say a lot?" Schro¨dinger does not himself say more than suggesting that the aperiodic crystal can contain a microcode.

We believe Schro¨dinger was deeply correct, and that the proper and deep understanding of his intuition is precisely that an aperiodic solid crystal can contain a wide variety of microconstraints, or micro boundary conditions, that help cause a wide variety of different specific events to happen in the cell or organism. Therefore we starkly identify information, which we here call "instructional information" or "biotic information," not with Shannon, but with constraints or boundary conditions.

The amount of information will be related to the diversity of constraints and the diversity of processes that they can partially cause to occur. By taking this step, we embed the concept of information in the ongoing processes of the biosphere, for they are causally relevant to that which happens in the unfolding of the biosphere.

We therefore conclude that constraints are information and, as we argue below, information is constraints which we term as instructional or biotic information to distinguish it from Shannon information. We use the term "instructional information" because of the instructional function this information performs and we sometimes call it "biotic information" because this is the domain it acts in, as opposed to human telecommunication or computer information systems where Shannon information operates. This step, identifying information as constraint or boundary condition, is perhaps the central step in our analysis. We believe it applies in the unfolding biosphere and the evolving universe, expanding and cooling and breaking symmetries, that we will discuss below.

Is this interpretation right? It certainly seems right. Precisely what the DNA molecule, an aperiodic solid, does, is to "specify" via the heterogeneity of its structural constraints on the behavior of RNA polymerase, the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA. Importantly, this constitutes the copying or propagating of information. Also, importantly, typically, the information contained in aperiodic solids requires complex solids, i.e., molecules, whose construction requires the linking of spontaneous and non-spontaneous, exergonic and endergonic, processes.

These linkages are part of the work cycles that cells carry out as they propagate organization.

It is essential to note that the set of constraints in a contemporary cell is not merely the DNA and RNA, but lies also in the specific stereochemistry of a vast horde of specific molecular species. So, when an enzyme binds two substrates and holds them in proximity, lowering the potential energy barrier to their joining, the enzyme is acting as a constraint on the motion of the two substrates, hence as a catalyst. The working of a cell is, in part, a complex web of constraints, or boundary conditions, which partially direct or cause the events which happen. Importantly, the propagating organization in the cell is the structural union of constraints as instructional information, the constrained release of energy as work, the use of work in the construction of copies of information, the use of work in the construction of other structures, and the construction of further constraints as instructional information. This instructional information further constrains the further release of energy in diverse specific ways, all of which propagates organization of process that completes a closure of tasks whereby the cell reproduces.

Our discussion here has some of the flavor of Sterelny and Griffiths (1999) in their discussion of an extended concept of information beyond DNA, RNA and protein sequences. On the other hand, none of those who have written on the concept of information in biology have taken up the struggle to relate it to constraints, work, and propagating organization of process such as that in reproducing cells.

04 薛定谔的非周期性晶体：作为约束或边界条件的「指示性」信息

在《生命是什么》一书中，薛定谔在 1992 年的著作中探讨了有机体中的秩序及基因的物理基础。他通过研究 X 射线诱导突变的频率，推测基因由几百到几千个原子组成，并指出统计力学的平衡无法解释有机体在世代间的稳定性。随后，他提出量子力学中的化学键是解释这一现象的关键。

薛定谔进一步巧妙地指出，生命的秩序不能依赖于周期性晶体，因为这种晶体无法传达大量信息。他认为非周期性晶体可以传达更多信息，甚至可以包含某种方式指定成年的微码。

薛定谔的预见非常准确，预示了 DNA 和遗传密码的发现。现在的问题是，非周期性晶体究竟如何「传达大量信息」？薛定谔仅暗示非周期性晶体可以包含一个微码，并未详细说明。

我们认为薛定谔的观点是深刻正确的。非周期性固体晶体可以包含各种微约束或微边界条件，这些条件能够引发细胞或有机体中各种特定事件。因此，我们将这种信息称为「指示性信息」或「生物信息」，而不是香农信息，而是与约束或边界条件相关的信息。

信息量的多少与这些约束的多样性及它们能引发的过程的多样性密切相关。通过这种方式，我们将信息的概念嵌入生物圈的持续进程中，因为这些信息在生物圈的展开过程中具有重要的因果作用。

我们因此得出结论，约束就是信息。正如我们在下文中所讨论的，信息也可以看作是约束，我们称之为指令性信息或生物信息，以区别于香农信息。我们使用「指令性信息」这个术语，是因为这种信息具有指令功能；有时也称其为「生物信息」，因为它作用于生物领域，而不同于香农信息主要用于人类电信或计算机信息系统。将信息识别为约束或边界条件，是我们分析中的核心步骤。我们认为这种分析适用于生物圈的演化和宇宙的演化，这些宇宙在扩展、冷却和打破对称性，接下来我们会详细讨论。

这种解释是否正确？看起来确实是正确的。DNA 分子作为一种非周期固体，通过其结构的异质性对 RNA 聚合酶的行为进行约束，从而「指定」DNA 转录为信使 RNA。重要的是，这构成了信息的复制和传播。同样重要的是，非周期固体中的信息通常需要复杂的固体来承载，即分子，这些分子的构成需要连接自发和非自发、放能和吸能过程。

这些连接是细胞在传播组织过程中执行的做功循环的一部分。

需要注意的是，现代细胞中的约束不仅限于 DNA 和 RNA，还涉及大量特定分子的立体化学特性。因此，当一种酶结合两个底物并将它们靠近，从而降低它们结合的能量障碍时，这种酶实际上是对底物的运动施加了约束，因而起到了催化剂的作用。细胞的运作实际上是一个复杂的约束网或边界条件，这些条件部分地引导或促成了各种事件的发生。重要的是，细胞中的组织传播是一系列约束结构的联合体，这些结构作为指令性信息，能量受控释放用于做功，做功用于构建信息副本和其他结构，并进一步构建新的约束作为指令性信息。这些信息以多种特定方式进一步约束能量的释放，推动过程的组织，完成细胞的复制任务。

我们的讨论有点类似于 Sterelny 和 Griffiths（1999）在他们探讨信息扩展概念（超越 DNA、RNA 和蛋白质序列）时的讨论。然而，尚无人将生物学中的信息概念与约束、做功和过程的传播（如细胞复制中的过程）联系起来。

### 05. The Relativity of Information

In the "Shannon information" section we have argued that the Shannon conception of information are not directly suited to describe the information of autonomous agents that propagate their organization. In the "Schro¨dinger's aperiodic crystal..." section we have defined a new form of information, instructional or biotic information as the constraints that direct the flow of free energy to do work.

The reader may legitimately ask the question "isn't information just information?", i.e., an invariant like the speed of light. Our response to this question is no, and to then clarify what seems arbitrary about the definition of information.

Instructional or biotic information is a useful definition for biotic systems just as Shannon information was useful for telecommunication channel engineering, and Kolmogorov (Shiryayev 1993) information was useful for the study of information compression with respect to Turing machines.

The definition of information is relative and depends on the context in which it is to be considered. There appears to be no such thing as absolute information that is an invariant that applies to all circumstances. Just as Shannon defined information in such a way as to understand the engineering of telecommunication channels, our definition of instructional or biotic information best describes the interaction and evolution of biological systems and the propagation of organization. Information is a tool and as such it comes in different forms. We therefore would like to suggest that information is not an invariant but rather a quantity that is relative to the environment in which it operates. It is also the case that the information in a system or structure is not an intrinsic property of that system or structure; rather it is sensitive to history and environment. To drive home this point we will now examine the historic context in which Shannon (1948) information emerged.

Before delving into the origin of Shannon information we will first examine the relationship of information and materiality. Information is about material things and furthermore is instantiated in material things but is not material itself. Information is an abstraction we use to describe the behavior of material things and often is thought as something that controls, in the cybernetic sense, material things. So what do we mean when we say the constraints are information and information is constraints as we did in the "Schro¨ dinger's aperiodic crystal..." section.

"The constraints are information" is a way to describe the limits on the behavior of an autonomous agent who acts on its own behalf but is nevertheless constrained by the internal logic that allows it to propagate its organization. This is consistent with Hayle's (1999, p. 72) description of the way information is regarded by information science: "It constructs information as the site of mastery and control over the material world." She claims, and we concur, that information science treats information as separate from the material base in which it is instantiated. This suggests that there is nothing intrinsic about information but rather it is merely a description of or a metaphor for the complex patterns of behavior of material things. In fact, the key is to what degree information is a completely vivid description of the objects in question.

This understanding of the nature of information arises from Shannon's (1948) original formulation of information, dating back to his original paper:

The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one that will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely.

A number of problems for biology emerge from this view of information. The first is that the number of possible messages is not finite because we are not able to prestate all possible preadaptations from which a particular message can be selected and therefore the Shannon measure breaks down. Another problem is that for Shannon the semantics or meaning of the message does not matter, whereas in biology the opposite is true. Biotic agents have purpose and hence meaning.

The third problem is that Shannon information is defined independent of the medium of its instantiation. This independence of the medium is at the heart of a strong AI approach in which it is claimed that human intelligence does not require a wet computer, the brain, to operate but can be instantiated onto a silicon-based computer. In the biosphere, however, one cannot separate the information from the material in which it is instantiated. The DNA is not a sign for something else it is the actual thing in itself, which regulates other genes, generates messenger RNA, which in turn control the production of proteins. Information on a computer or a telecommunication device can slide from one computer or device to another and then via a printer to paper and not really change, McLuhan's "the medium is the message" aside. This is not true of living things. The same genotype does not always produce the same phenotype.

According to the Shannon definition of information, a structured set of numbers like the set of even numbers has less information than a set of random numbers because one can predict the sequence of even numbers. By this argument, a random soup of organic chemicals has more information that a structured biotic agent. The biotic agent has more meaning than the soup, however. The living organism with more structure and more organization has less Shannon information. This is counterintuitive to a biologist's understanding of a living organism. We therefore conclude that the use of Shannon information to describe a biotic system would not be valid. Shannon information for a biotic system is simply a category error.

A living organism has meaning because it is an autonomous agent acting on its own behalf. A random soup of organic chemicals has no meaning and no organization. We may therefore conclude that a central feature of life is organization—organization that propagates.

05 信息的相对性

在「香农信息」部分，我们论述了 Shannon 的信息概念不适合直接描述自主智能体的组织传播。在「薛定谔的非周期晶体……」部分，我们定义了一种新的信息形式 —— 指令性或生物性信息，作为引导自由能流动以进行做功的约束。

读者可能会合理地提出这样的问题：「信息不都是一样的吗？」，即像光速一样的不变。对此，我们的回答是否定的，并且我们会解释信息定义中看似任意的部分。

指令信息或生物信息对生物系统的研究非常有用，就像香农信息对电信通道工程有帮助一样，Kolmogorov（Shiryayev 1993）信息在图灵机的信息压缩研究中也起到了重要作用。

信息的定义是相对的，取决于它被考虑的背景。似乎没有一种绝对的信息是不变的，适用于所有情况。正如香农为理解电信通道工程定义了信息一样，我们对指令信息或生物信息的定义最能描述生物系统的相互作用、进化及组织的传播。信息是一种工具，因此它有不同的形式。因此，我们建议信息不是不变的，而是相对于其环境而变化的量。系统或结构中的信息也不是其固有属性；它对历史和环境是敏感的。为了说明这一点，我们将考察香农（1948）信息出现的历史背景。

在探讨香农信息的起源之前，我们先来了解一下信息和物质之间的关系。信息是关于物质的，同时存在于物质之中，但信息本身不是物质。信息是一个抽象概念，用来描述物质的行为，通常被认为是在控制论意义上控制物质的工具。那么，当我们在「薛定谔的非周期晶体...」一节中说「约束是信息，信息是约束」时，我们是什么意思呢？

「约束是信息」是指自主智能体的行为受到限制，这些限制源于其内部逻辑，确保其组织能够持续。这与 Hayle（1999, p. 72）对信息的描述一致：「信息被构建为对物质世界的掌控和控制的场所。」她认为，信息科学将信息视为独立于其物质基础的存在。我们同意这一观点，这意味着信息本身没有内在属性，而是对物质行为复杂模式的描述或隐喻。事实上，关键在于信息在多大程度上能够生动地描述对象。

这种对信息本质的理解来源于香农（1948）最初对信息的表述，可以追溯到他最初的论文：

通信的基本问题是在某个点精确或大致地再现另一个点选择的消息。消息经常有意义，即它们根据某些系统与某些物理或概念实体相关联。这些消息的语义方面与工程问题无关。重要的是实际消息是从一组可能的消息中选出的。系统必须设计为对每种可能的选择进行操作，而不是仅对实际将被选择的消息进行操作，因为在设计时这是未知的。如果集合中的消息数量是有限的，那么这个数量或这个数量的任何单调函数可以被视为当从集合中选择一个消息时产生的信息量的度量，所有选择都是同等可能的。

从这种信息观来看，生物学中出现了许多问题。首先是可能消息的数量不是有限的，因为我们不能预先说明所有可能的预适应，从中可以选择特定的消息，因此 Shannon 度量失效。另一个问题是对 Shannon 来说消息的语义或意义无关紧要，而在生物学中情况正好相反。生物智能体有目的，因此有意义。

第三个问题是，香农信息的定义与其实现的媒介无关。这种媒介独立性是强 AI 方法的核心思想之一，即认为人类智能不需要依赖于大脑这种「湿计算机」，而可以在基于硅的计算机上实现。然而，在生物圈中，信息与其载体是无法分割的。DNA 本身并不是其他事物的符号，而是实际存在的实体，能够调节其他基因，生成信使 RNA，进而控制蛋白质的生产。计算机或电信设备上的信息可以从一台设备转移到另一台设备，再通过打印机转移到纸上，而不会发生实质性的变化，撇开 McLuhan 的「媒介即信息」理论不谈。但对于生物体来说，情况并非如此。同样的基因型并不总是产生相同的表型。

根据香农信息的定义，像偶数集合这样的结构化数字集合比随机数集合包含更少的信息，因为人们可以预测偶数序列。按照这个逻辑，一碗随机的有机化学物质比一个结构化的生物智能体拥有更多的信息。然而，生物智能体比化学物质汤具有更多的意义。具有更多结构和组织的生物体反而具有更少的香农信息。这与生物学家对生物体的理解是相悖的。因此，我们得出结论，使用香农信息来描述生物系统是不合适的。对于生物系统来说，香农信息只是一个类别错误。

一个生物体具有意义，因为它是一个自主智能体，为自身行动。而一碗随机的有机化学物质既没有意义也没有组织。因此，我们可以得出结论，生命的一个核心特征是具有组织性 —— 这种组织性是能够传播的。

### 06. Semiosis as a Special Case of Constraint as Information

We wish next to consider the minimal physical conditions for semiosis. We shall not concern ourselves with fully human linguistic symbols, but with the semiosis of our minimal molecular autonomous agent. Consider an agent that is confronted by molecules in its environment, which constitute "yuck" or "yum." To respond to these environmental features, the agent, assumed to be bounded (Kauffman and Clayton 2006), must also have yuck and yum receptors, capable in the simplest case of "recognizing" molecules of yuck or yum, and responding appropriately by avoiding yuck and eating yum. Assume such molecular machinery exists in the agent.

They of course exist in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We wish to say that the agent confronting yuck or yum receives information "about" yuck or yum. This appears to constitute the minimal physical system to which semiotic information might apply. And it is worth noting that the "meaning," or semiotic content of the yuck and yum molecules is built into the propagating organization of the cell. The cell, we want to say, has embodied knowledge and know-how with respect to the proper responses to yuck and yum, which was assembled for the agent and its descendants by heritable variation and natural selection.

The existence of yuck and yum as semiotic signs is a subcase of constraint as information. How does the agent detect yuck? A concrete case would be that a yuck molecule binds a yuck receptor, constraining the receptor's motions, which in turn acts as a constraint in unleashing a cell signaling cascade leading to motion away from yuck. Further, if yuck is present below a detection threshold, it will not be detected by the agent. Hence that threshold, and the receptor itself, act as a constraints partially determining the behavior of the agent in fleeing or not fleeing.

One can construct an underlying set theoretical interpretation for yuck and yum semanticsin two equivalent ways: The first posits a set of instances, and a set of properties to which each instance is assigned. The second posits a set of instances and detectors, or classifying operators, that classify "properties" ofinstances. Note thatin the second case, those properties need not themselves be discussed because the detectors do the job. If the second stance is taken, then detectors, "yuck" and "not yuck," suffice and no extension beyond instructional information is required. If the second stance suffices, we want to say not only that constraints are information but also that information is constraints. We recognize that this second step is arguable and do not analyze this issue further here.

Semiotic information can not itself embody "agentness," for it has no agency; but identified agents can be observed to respect the semiotic interpretation like yuck and yum. This inspectable behavior provides the opportunity to attribute constraintdirected behavior to the agent organism.

Another important point in this attempt to understand propagating organization is that the semiotic behavior can identify a source of free energy, yum in this case, from which work can be extracted and propagate in the cell. This behavior is part of a theory that unifies matter, energy, information and propagating organization.

We end this section with the description of a final interesting feature of the yum receptor. A wide variety of molecules might bind to the yum receptor with modest affinity, hence mimic true yum molecules. So the yum receptor can be "fooled." This might allow another agent to emit a poison that mimics the yum molecule, fools the receptor, and leads to the death of the agent. So evolves the biosphere. Now ask, can a Shannon channel be "fooled?" Clearly noise can be present in the channel. Due to noise a 1 value can replace a 0 value in the constrained sense of 1 and 0 as subsets of the physical carriers of 1 and 0. But the Shannon channel cannot be fooled: "fooling" is a semantic property of detectors, hence not present in a Shannon channel.

Therefore, while one might be tempted to measure the amount of semiotic information using a Shannon-like approach, the fact that semiosis in an organism can be fooled suggests that a symbol based Shannon move is inappropriate.

We conclude that semiotic information in molecular agents such as organisms is a special case of information as constraint. For semiotic information to be "about" something, and to be extracted, it appears that a constraint must be present in one or more variables that are themselves causally derived from that which the information is about.

Like the threshold level of yum needed for detection, to use the information, the extracted semoitic information must do work on some system. That work might copy the information, for example into a record, or might construct constraints on the release of energy which is further work. Here, semiotic information becomes part of propagating organization.

We comment that in standard semiotic analyses with human agents and language, there are three elements to semiotic information, namely,

1. The subject of the information or the agent being informed;

2. The object of the information or what the information is about; and

3. The possibly arbitrary, sign or symbol referring to the object.

4. With Monod (1971) in Chance and Necessity we add that allosteric chemistry allows arbitrary molecules to cause events. If we wish to call such molecules "symbols" that "refer to" "yum," the standard semiotic analysis just noted applies to molecular autonomous agents. Note that Monod's example is broader than DNA, RNA and proteins. It is the general arbitrariness of allosteric chemistry that allows arbitrary molecules to cause events. Information is thus broader than coding.

06 将符号学作为约束即信息的特例

我们接下来希望探讨符号作用所需的最小物理条件。我们不讨论人类完整的语言符号，而是关注一个最小分子自主智能体的符号作用。设想一个智能体在其环境中遇到分子，这些分子可能是「讨厌的」或「美味的」。为了对这些环境特征作出反应，假设这个智能体是有边界的（Kauffman 和 Clayton 2006)，它还必须有能够识别「讨厌」和「美味」分子的受体，并通过避开讨厌的分子和食用美味的分子来作出适当反应。假设这种分子机制存在于智能体中。

这种机制确实存在于原核细胞和真核细胞中。我们要说明的是，面对「讨厌」或「美味」分子的智能体接收到的是关于这些分子的信息。这似乎是符号信息可以应用的最小物理系统。值得注意的是，「讨厌」和「美味」分子的「意义」或符号内容已经内嵌在细胞的组织结构中。可以说，细胞具有对「讨厌」和「美味」作出正确反应的知识和技能，这些是通过可遗传的变异和自然选择为智能体及其后代所积累的。

「讨厌」和「美味」作为符号标志的存在是「约束作为信息」的一个子例。智能体是如何检测到「讨厌」的呢？一个具体的例子是，当一个「讨厌」分子与其受体结合时，会限制受体的运动，进而触发细胞信号级联，导致智能体远离「讨厌」分子。此外，如果「讨厌」分子的浓度低于检测阈值，智能体将无法检测到。因此，这个阈值和受体本身作为约束，部分决定了智能体是否会逃离。

可以用两种等价的方式构建「厌恶和喜爱」语义的集合论解释：第一种方式是设定一个实例集合和一个属性集合，每个实例都分配到某个属性。第二种方式是设定一个实例集合和检测器，或分类操作符，用于分类实例的属性。注意，在第二种情况下，不需要讨论这些属性，因为检测器已经完成了做功。如果采用第二种方式，那么「厌恶」和「非厌恶」的检测器就足够了，不需要额外的信息。如果第二种方式足够，我们不仅要说约束是信息，还要说信息就是约束。我们认识到这个观点是有争议的，但在这里不做进一步分析。

符号信息本身不能体现「智能体性」（因为它没有代理能力）；但可以观察到已识别的智能体尊重「厌恶和喜爱」这样的符号解释。这种可观察的行为使我们有机会将约束导向行为归因于智能体生物。

在理解传播性组织的过程中，另一个重要的点是符号行为可以识别自由能的来源（在这种情况下是喜爱），从中提取能量并在细胞中传播。这种行为是一个统一物质、能量、信息和传播性组织的理论的一部分。

我们最后来描述一下 yum 受体的一个有趣特性。各种分子可能会以适中的亲和力与 yum 受体结合，从而模仿真正的 yum 分子，这意味着 yum 受体可能会被「欺骗」。例如，某个智能体可能发出一种模仿 yum 分子的毒药，欺骗受体，从而导致该智能体的死亡。这是生物圈进化的一部分。那么，Shannon 信道是否可以被「欺骗」呢？显然，信道中可能存在噪音。由于噪音的存在，1 和 0 的值可能会互换。然而，Shannon 信道本身不能被欺骗，因为「欺骗」是检测器的语义属性，而非 Shannon 信道的属性。

因此，尽管我们可能会尝试使用类似 Shannon 的方法来测量符号信息量，但由于生物体中的符号过程可以被欺骗，这表明基于符号的 Shannon 方法是不合适的。

我们得出结论，分子智能体（如生物体）中的符号信息是约束信息的一种特例。为了使符号信息「关于」某物并能被提取，必须在一个或多个变量中存在约束，这些变量是从符号信息所「关于」的对象中因果导出的。

就像检测 yum 需要达到一定的阈值水平一样，提取的符号信息必须对某个系统起作用，才能被利用。例如，这种作用可能是将信息复制到记录中，或者是构建能量释放的约束条件。在这种情况下，符号信息成为传播组织的一部分。

在标准的符号分析中（涉及人类智能体和语言），符号信息包括三个要素：

1. 信息的主体或接收信息的智能体；

2. 信息的对象或信息所「关于」的内容；

3. 可能是任意的符号或标志，指代某个对象。

4. 根据 Monod（1971）在《机遇与必然》一书中的观点，我们可以补充说，变构化学（allosteric chemistry）允许任意分子引发事件。如果我们愿意将这些分子称为「指代美味的符号」，那么标准的符号学分析就可以应用于分子自主智能体（molecular autonomous agents)。请注意，Monod 的例子不仅限于 DNA、RNA 和蛋白质。正是由于变构化学的普遍任意性，任意分子都可以引发事件。因此，信息的范围比编码更广泛。

### 07. Heritable Variation and Natural Selection as Assembly Processes

We have now grounded biotic information as "instructional information" or constraint, or boundary condition, that partially causes subsequent events in the unfolding of the biosphere. In this view information is not an abstraction, but is causally efficacious in the biosphere and we argue below in the unfolding of the abiotic universe. And we have grounded semiotic information as information detected about external (to the agent) features of the environment about which it learns. These semiotic cases are also cases of constraints, or boundary conditions, detecting and categorizing inputs and partially causing subsequent events. We note again that we remain neutral for the moment about whether information needs to be extended beyond instructional information for a set theory analysis of the categorization of objects.

At the level of complex molecules, as noted above, the universe has not had time to create all possible versions. For example, the universe has not had time to create all proteins to length 200, by about 10 to the 67th power repetitions of the history of the universe.

Consider a simple set of organic molecules and all the reactions they can collectively undergo. Call the initial set of molecules the Actual. Now among the reactions that might happen, some may lead to molecular species that are not present in the initial Actual. Call these new molecular species the Adjacent Possible.

They are the molecular species that are reachable in a single reaction step from the current actual. It is of fundamental importance that the biosphere has been evolving into the Adjacent Possible for 3.8 billion years, from an initial diversity of perhaps 1,000 organic molecules to trillions. The biotic world advances into the adjacent possible in terms of molecules, morphologies, species, behaviors, and technologically from pressure flaked stones; it lurks in everything from the global economy to the computer, and the millions of products in the current global economy.

Once at a level of complexity sufficiently above the atom, the universe, the biosphere, and the technosphere can never exhaust the diversity of things and events that can happen. The evolving universe and biosphere advance persistently into the adjacent possible. This means that what comes to exist at these levels of complexity is typically unique in the universe.

Now consider a heritable variation which gives rise to a new constraint, physical biotic information, that helps cause a sequence of events in a molecular agent. If that heritable variation is to the selective benefit of the agent, the new constraint, the new biotic information, will be grafted into the organism, its progeny, and the ongoing evolution of the biosphere.

It is essential to note that in the absence of heritable variation, an increase in fitness, and natural selection, this new functionality would not come to exist in the universe: but lungs and flight have come to exist. The mechanisms of heritable variation and natural selection comprise an assembly process by which propagating organization is modified in normal Darwinian adaptations and preadaptations where new functionalities arise, and these modifications are built into the ongoing evolution of the biosphere.

It is clear then, that heritable variation and natural selection are sufficient mechanisms in the biosphere to build an expanding mesh of functionalities as the biosphere invades the adjacent possible. We will ask next whether similar processes can happen in the abiotic universe.

The evolution of the abiotic expanding universe: propagating organization diversifying sources of constraint, free energy, and coupling of spontaneous and non-spontaneous processes

We here ask whether we can find generalizations of the above analysis of information, matter, energy, constraint, work, in the biosphere, in the abiotic expanding universe.

For some time, scholars have struggled to find the union of matter, energy, and information. Cases such as Maxwell's demon, the Bekenstein bound on the entropy of a black hole, and the holographic principle, all seem to be places in physics where matter, energy, and information come together. These cases merit attention, but we leave them unanalyzed, except for this comment.

For information to be united with matter and energy, information must be part of the physical unfolding of the universe. Thus, consider Maxwell's demon. It has been shown that the demon cannot "win" with respect to the Second Law of Thermodynamics for a closed equilibrium system (Kauffman 2000). However, in a nonequilibrium setting, the demon can win by making measurements that reduce the entropy of the measured system, with respect to the demon, faster than the most compressed record of the measured system grows, on average, in length. Now physicists usually end their argument with a claim rather like, "Then, in principle, work could be extracted." Such a statement is inadequate for a theory that unites matter, energy, and information. What is required is that, in the non-equilibrium setting, a displacement from equilibrium that is a source of free energy must be detected by at least one measurement; a physical system able to couple to that source of free energy must have come to exist and must actually extract free energy, and must release that energy in a constrained way to carry out actual work.

Thereafter, this work may propagate. If we conceive of an abiotic physical system able to carry out these processes of measurement and work extraction in the abiotic universe, it will have to be an abiotically derived system able to perform such measurements, recording the results, and employ the record of the measurements to extract actual work. Such a system will be a case of propagating organization with boundary conditions as constraints, including measurements in the record as constraints on the behavior of the system conditional on the recorded measurements, and the constrained release of energy in work. Whether the coming into existence in the universe of such a system is plausible abiotically is certainly open to question but may be worthy of consideration. Biotically, of course, such systems abound: sources of free energy from sunlight to prey are detected and coupled to work extraction. Records of sources of free energy in the form of food are seen in ant phermone trails. The measurement of a source of free energy and extracting that free energy typically involves thresholds and other constraints or boundary conditions. For example, ants will not follow a phermone trail if it is below a detection threshold, and the boundaries of the trail are boundary conditions on the ants' motions.

These considerations suggest that we take information to be constraint or its physical equivalent, boundary conditions that partially cause events, where the coming into existence of the constraint is itself part of propagating organization. If we do so, the issue starts to clarify in a simple way. It is fully familiar in physics that one must specify the laws, particles, the initial and boundary conditions, then calculate the behavior of the system in a defined state space. Now it is common, as noted, in physics, to "put in by hand" the boundary conditions, as in the cylinder and piston case. But in the evolving biosphere, itself part of the evolving universe, and in the evolving universe as a whole, new boundary conditions come into existence and partially determine the future unfolding of the biosphere or the universe. These evolving boundary conditions and constraints are part of the propagating organization of the universe.

We consider a single, but complex case in cosmic evolution. It is well known that molecular grains are found in interstellar space. These grains aggregate up to the scale of planetessimals. Now it is also well known that the grains have surfaces with complex molecular features on which complex chemistry appears to be occurring.

The grains themselves act as constraints, or boundary conditions, that confine reacting substrates, hence may catalyze reactions, some of which may be endergonic, requiring, for example, photons. In some cases, the product molecules presumably are bound to the growing grain, thereby modifying the boundary conditions afforded by the grain, which in turn modifies the chemical reactions that can occur. Furthermore, the product molecules can be novel substrates—hence novel sources of free energy—which again allow novel chemical reactions to occur. In short, the grains appear to behave as constraints that can partially guide spontaneous or nonspontaneous processes, can, in addition, link spontaneous and non-spontaneous processes, can create new constraints enabling such processes and linked processes, and can create novel sources of free energy in the form of novel substrates able to enter into new chemical reactions.

Assume the above account is roughly correct. Then the growing grains appear to be cases in which matter, energy, and continuously evolving boundary conditions and novel sources of free energy emerge, and condition the future evolution of the grains. The grains are at levels of complexity sufficiently above atoms so that what occurs is typically unique in the universe. It seems virtually sure that no two modest size grains are molecularly identical. Here we confront a union of matter, energy, and evolving and diversifying boundary conditions linking, for example, spontaneous and non-spontaneous processes, and providing diversifying sources of free energy, which alter the ever diversifying structures that come to exist in the evolving expanding universe.

If this approach has merit, it appears to afford a direct union of matter, energy, and information as constraint or boundary condition.

07 可遗传变异和自然选择作为组装过程

我们现在已经将生物信息定义为「指令性信息」或约束条件，这些信息在生物圈的发展过程中部分引发了后续事件。从这个角度来看，信息不是抽象的，而是在生物圈中有实际效果的。我们将在后文讨论它在无生命宇宙发展中的因果作用。我们还将符号学信息定义为关于环境外部特征的信息，这些特征是智能体学习的对象。这些符号学案例也是约束条件的一部分，能够探测和分类输入，并部分引发后续事件。我们目前对于是否需要将信息扩展到指令信息之外，以进行对象分类的集合论分析保持中立立场。

在复杂分子的层面，如前所述，宇宙还没有时间创造所有可能的分子版本。例如，宇宙还没有时间创造所有长度为 200 个氨基酸的蛋白质，这需要大约 10 的 67 次方倍的宇宙历史重复。

考虑一组简单的有机分子及其可能发生的所有反应。将这组初始分子称为 Actual（实际）。在所有可能发生的反应中，有些反应可能会产生最初 Actual 中不存在的分子种类。将这些新的分子种类称为 Adjacent Possible（相邻可能）。

这些相邻可能的分子种类是通过一步反应从当前 Actual 中可达的分子种类。生物圈在过去 38 亿年里一直在向 Adjacent Possible 演化，从最初可能只有 1000 种有机分子的多样性发展到数万亿种。在分子、形态、物种、行为以及技术方面（从压力打制石器到全球经济和计算机），生物世界一直在向相邻可能进步；它存在于当前全球经济中的数百万种产品中。

一旦达到远高于原子水平的复杂程度，宇宙、生物圈和技术圈永远不会耗尽可能发生的事物和事件的多样性。不断演化的宇宙和生物圈持续地进入 Adjacent Possible。这意味着在这些复杂程度上出现的事物通常在宇宙中是独一无二的。

现在考虑一种可遗传的变异，它引入了一种新的约束，物理生物信息，这有助于在一个分子智能体中引发一系列事件。如果这种可遗传的变异对智能体有选择性优势，这种新的约束、新的生物信息将被融入该生物体及其后代中，并进入生物圈的持续进化中。

需要注意的是，如果没有遗传变异、适应度的提升和自然选择，这些新功能就不会在宇宙中出现；但肺和飞行已经出现了。遗传变异和自然选择的机制构成了一个组装过程，通过这个过程，传播的组织在正常的达尔文适应和前适应中被修改，新功能因此产生，这些修改被融入到生物圈的持续进化中。

因此，很明显，遗传变异和自然选择是生物圈中构建不断扩展的功能网络的充分机制，因为生物圈在不断探索新的可能性。接下来我们将探讨，在无生命的宇宙中是否可以发生类似的过程。

无生命的扩展宇宙的进化：传播组织、多样化的约束源、自由能以及自发过程与非自发过程的耦合在这里，我们探讨是否可以在无生命的扩展宇宙中，对信息、物质、能量、约束和做功进行一般化的分析。

长久以来，学者们一直在努力寻找物质、能量和信息的结合点。诸如麦克斯韦妖、黑洞熵的贝肯斯坦界限和全息原理等案例，似乎都是物理学中物质、能量和信息结合的地方。这些案例值得关注，但在此我们不做深入分析，仅做简要评论。

要将信息与物质和能量结合在一起，信息必须是宇宙物理过程中的一部分。我们可以用麦克斯韦妖来说明这一点。研究表明，在封闭平衡系统中，麦克斯韦妖无法违背热力学第二定律（Kauffman 2000)。然而，在非平衡环境中，麦克斯韦妖可以通过测量来降低系统的熵，使其减少的速度超过系统记录长度的增加速度。物理学家通常会说「原则上可以提取功」，但这种说法不足以解释物质、能量和信息的结合。在非平衡环境中，我们需要通过测量来发现平衡状态的偏离，这些偏离是自由能的来源；还需要物理系统能够耦合到这些自由能，并且实际提取自由能，并以受控方式释放能量来进行实际做功。

此后，这项研究可能会进一步扩展。如果我们设想一个无生命的物理系统能够在无生命的宇宙中进行这些测量和做功提取过程，那么它必须是一个能够执行测量、记录结果并利用这些记录来提取能量的系统。这样的系统将是一个在特定边界条件下运作的案例，这些边界条件包括记录的测量结果作为系统行为的约束，并在这些记录的基础上有条件地释放能量进行做功。这样的系统能否在宇宙中无生命地出现，虽然值得怀疑，但也许值得探讨。

在生物界，这样的系统非常常见：从阳光到猎物，自由能的来源被检测到并与能量提取相结合。例如，蚂蚁通过费洛蒙路径记录食物的自由能来源。测量和提取自由能通常涉及阈值和其他约束条件。比如，如果费洛蒙路径的浓度低于检测阈值，蚂蚁就不会沿着路径行进，而路径的边界则限制了蚂蚁的行动范围。

这些考虑表明，我们可以将信息看作是一种约束或其物理等价物，即部分引发事件的边界条件，而这种约束的形成本身也是组织传播的一部分。这样一来，问题就变得更加清晰了。在物理学中，我们需要明确定律、粒子、初始和边界条件，然后在定义好的状态空间中计算系统的行为。这在物理学中是非常熟知的过程，通常是以「手动」方式设置边界条件，例如在气缸和活塞的案例中。但是在不断演化的生物圈中（它本身是不断演化的宇宙的一部分），以及在整个演化的宇宙中，新的边界条件不断出现，并部分决定了生物圈或宇宙的未来发展。这些新的边界条件和约束是宇宙组织传播的一部分。

我们来看一个复杂但单一的宇宙演化案例。众所周知，在星际空间中存在分子颗粒，这些颗粒逐渐聚集成行星体。目前也了解到，这些颗粒的表面具有复杂的分子特征，并且在这些表面上似乎发生着复杂的化学反应。

这些颗粒本身作为约束条件或边界条件，限制了反应底物的活动，因此可能催化一些反应，其中一些反应是吸能的，例如需要光子。在某些情况下，产物分子可能会结合到生长的颗粒上，从而改变颗粒的边界条件，进而影响后续的化学反应。此外，产物分子可以作为新的底物 —— 也就是新的自由能来源 —— 从而促成新的化学反应。简而言之，这些颗粒可以作为约束条件，部分引导自发或非自发的过程，甚至能连接自发和非自发过程，创造新的约束条件和新的自由能来源，促进新的化学反应。

假设上述描述大致正确，那么，这些生长中的颗粒展示了物质、能量以及不断演化的边界条件和新的自由能来源的相互作用，并影响它们未来的演化。这些颗粒的复杂程度远高于原子，因此其发生的现象在宇宙中是独特的。几乎可以肯定，没有两个中等大小的颗粒在分子结构上是完全相同的。在这里，我们看到的是物质、能量和不断演化、多样化的边界条件的结合，这些条件链接了自发和非自发过程，并提供多样化的自由能来源，改变了在扩展宇宙中不断演化的结构。

如果这种方法有其优点，那么它似乎提供了一种将物质、能量和信息作为约束或边界条件直接结合的途径。

### 08. Population genetics and evolution in any biosphere

Philosophy of biology has largely grown up in the constrained environment of current terrestrial life. Its analysis of heritable variation and selection has largely ignored the physical basis of the propagating organization and closure of tasks that achieve the living state and underlie heritable variation. Moreover, we have discussed above the fact that at levels of complexity above atoms, the universe is on a unique trajectory into the Adjacent Possible. These physical facts are utterly requisite to descent with heritable variation and natural selection. But these aspects are simply assumed, without deeper analysis, as available to evolution. Life would have a hard time evolving at the level of complexity of quarks, gluons, and atoms.

The diversity is insufficient at least. While we do not now know the implications of the broadened view of a general biology and the evolution of biospheres in a general biology, we suspect that these issues are worth careful consideration. We will make or find life anew in the next century almost certainly. Adaptation, preadaptation, the relation between the specific physical basis of each form of life and the capacity for heritable variations will become the subjects of intense study. And meanwhile, the possibility of general laws remains open to investigation. For example, it has long been hypothesized that cells are dynamically critical, poised between order and chaos. Recent evidence begins to support this possibility (Ramo et al. 2006; Serra et al. 2004; Shmulevich et al. 2005; M. Nykter et al. in preparation). Since critical networks are rare in the space of dynamical systems, if cells are critical it is precisely a marriage of self organization affording such critical behavior, and the selective usefulness of criticality, that would account for the putative results noted above.

Perhaps molecular autonomous agents in any biosphere are dynamically critical. Perhaps the hinted fourth law of thermodynamics discussed in Investigations is true of all biospheres. We simply do not know. But that does not imply that we should not search for such laws—laws that are emergent with respect to physics and part of the emergent, endlessly "creative" universe in which we appear to live.

We would end by inviting philosophers of biology, physics, and others, to help think through the potential implications of a new scientific world view that goes beyond the reductionism of the past three and a half centuries to emergence and a creative evolution in biology and the human economic and cultural realms that cannot be prestated. We believe that such a change in scientific worldview, if merited, will bring with it large societal changes.

08 任何生物圈中的种群遗传学和进化

生物学哲学主要是在地球生命的限制条件下发展起来的。在分析遗传变异和自然选择时，往往忽略了支撑生命状态的物理基础，这些基础包括传播的组织结构和任务的完成。此外，我们之前讨论过，在原子以上的复杂性层次上，宇宙正沿着独特的轨迹进入邻近可能性。这些物理事实对于遗传变异和自然选择的后代来说是必不可少的。然而，这些方面通常只是被简单地假设为进化所能利用的，而缺乏深入的分析。生命在夸克、胶子和原子级别的复杂性上进化将会非常困难。

多样性至少是不够的。虽然我们目前还不知道广义生物学和生物圈演化的广泛视角究竟意味着什么，但我们认为这些问题值得深入研究。在未来的一个世纪里，我们几乎肯定会重新创造或发现新的生命形式。适应、预适应、每种生命形式的具体物理基础与其遗传变异能力之间的关系将成为研究的重点。同时，普通定律的可能性仍然存在。例如，长期以来，人们假设细胞在动态上是临界的，处于秩序与混沌之间的平衡状态。最近的证据开始支持这种可能性（Ramo et al. 2006; Serra et al. 2004; Shmulevich et al. 2005; M. Nykter et al. in preparation）。由于临界网络在动态系统空间中很少见，如果细胞是临界的，这正是自组织提供这种临界行为和临界性的选择性有用性结合的结果，这将解释上述假定的结果。

或许任何生物圈中的分子自主智能体（molecular autonomous agents）都是动态关键的。也许《Investigations》中讨论的热力学第四定律对所有生物圈都适用。我们尚不确定，但这并不意味着我们不应该寻找这样的规律 —— 这些规律相对于物理学是涌现的，并且是我们似乎生活在其中的涌现的、无尽「创造性」的宇宙的一部分。

我们希望邀请生物学、物理学等领域的哲学家，一起思考新的科学世界观的潜在影响。这种世界观超越了过去三百五十年的还原论，转向了生物学及其在人类经济文化领域中无法预先陈述的创造性进化。我们相信，如果这种科学世界观的改变是合理的，它将带来巨大的社会变化。

### 09. Summary

We have traveled along a new path in which we have discussed Darwinian adaptations and the non-reducibility of biology to physics, the mysterious Darwinian preadaptations which seem to preclude finite prestatement and lead to evolution where the state space cannot be prestated. This brings us to serious doubts about whether Shannon information directly applies to the evolution of the biosphere, and leads to Schro¨dinger's aperiodic crystal and the hypothesis that information is constraints and boundary conditions, to semiotic information and records, and to the realization that, in the biosphere, it is heritable variation and natural selection that build the intricate web of propagating organization. This provides the basis for considering a new union of matter, energy, information-constraint, and work in cells.

This leads to questions about the abiotic universe, where information as boundary conditions affords a simple means to unite matter energy and information.

We have been led to doubt that Shannon information is physically instantiated, whereas the evolving universe and biosphere are. We seek a new theory of propagating organization, the unfolding of Kant's statement at the outset of this article. We further seek a theory of the diversifying sources of free energy and constraints that are used to couple spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes into an ever expanding diversity of processes in the biosphere and universe. We do not believe our analysis is fully adequate, but believe it is a start.

总结

我们探索了一条新的道路，讨论了达尔文适应性和生物学不可还原于物理学的问题，以及神秘的达尔文预适应性（Darwinian preadaptations)，这些预适应性似乎排除了有限的预陈述，并导致状态空间无法预先陈述的进化过程。这使我们对香农信息（Shannon information）是否直接适用于生物圈的进化产生了严重怀疑，并引导我们思考 Schrödinger 的非周期晶体（aperiodic crystal）和信息是约束与边界条件的假设，思考符号信息和记录，并认识到在生物圈中，是可遗传变异和自然选择构建了复杂的传播组织网络。这为我们提供了在细胞中考虑物质、能量、信息约束和做功的基础。

这引发了关于非生物宇宙的问题，在非生物宇宙中，信息作为边界条件提供了一种将物质、能量和信息结合起来的简单方法。

我们开始怀疑香农信息是否真的存在于物理世界中，而宇宙和生物圈却显然在不断演化。我们希望能找到一种新的传播组织理论，这也是康德在本文开篇所提到的概念的延伸。我们还希望找到一种理论，解释自由能和各种约束的多样化来源，以及它们如何将自发和非自发过程耦合起来，形成生物圈和宇宙中越来越多样化的过程。虽然我们知道我们的分析还不够全面，但这只是一个起点。
