## 0201矩阵消元

OK. This is it. This is then the second lecture in linear algebra, and I've put below my main topics for today. I put right there a system of equations that's going to be our example to work with. But what are we going to do with it? We're going to solve it. And the method of solution will not be determinants. Determinants are something that will come later. The method we'll use is called elimination, and it's the way every software package solves equations.

And so an elimination, well, if it succeeds, it gets the answer. And normally it does succeed. If the matrix A that's coming into that system is a good matrix, and I think this one is, then elimination will work, we'll get the answer in an efficient way. But why don't we, as long as we're sort of seeing how elimination works, it's always good to ask, how could it fail? So at the same time, we'll see how elimination decides whether the matrix is a good one or has problems. Then to complete the answer, there's an obvious step of back substitution.

In fact, the idea of elimination is, you would have thought of it, right? I mean, Gauss thought of it before we did, but only because he was born earlier. It's a natural idea. And died earlier, too. OK. And you've seen the idea. But now, the part that I want to show you is elimination expressed in matrix language, because the whole course, all the key ideas get expressed as matrix operations, not as words. And one of the operations, of course, that we'll meet is how do we multiply matrices and why.

好，我们开始吧。这是线性代数课程的第二讲，我已经在下面列出了今天的主要话题。这里有一个方程组的例子，我们将用它来进行实践。那么，我们要用它做什么呢？我们要解这个方程组。不过，我们使用的解法不会是行列式法。行列式会在后面的课程中讲到。我们将要使用的方法叫做消元法，这也是所有数学软件包解方程时采用的方法。

消元法如果成功的话，就能得到答案。通常情况下，它都是能成功的。如果方程组中的矩阵 A 是一个良好的矩阵（我认为这个例子中的矩阵就是），那么消元法就会奏效，我们就能高效地得到答案。但是，既然我们正在学习消元法的工作原理，我们不妨也思考一下：它在什么情况下会失败呢？提出这样的问题总是好的。因此，我们同时也会看到消元法是如何判断一个矩阵是良好的还是有问题的。最后，为了得到完整的解，我们还需要进行一个显而易见的步骤，那就是回代。

实际上，消元法的概念是一个相当直观的想法。虽然高斯比我们早提出了这个方法，但这只是因为他生活在更早的年代。这个概念本身是很自然的。现在，你们可能已经对这个概念有所了解。接下来，我想向大家展示如何用矩阵语言来表达消元法。这是因为在整个课程中，所有的关键概念都将以矩阵运算的形式呈现，而不是用文字描述。当然，我们将会学习的一个重要操作就是如何进行矩阵乘法以及为什么要这样做。

OK. So there's a system of equations. Three equations and three unknowns. And there's the matrix, the three by three matrix that, so this is the system A x equal b, you could say. This is our system to solve, A x equal, and the right hand side is that vector two, twelve, two. OK. Now, when I describe elimination, it gets to be a pain to keep writing the equal signs and the pluses and so on. It's that matrix that totally matters. Everything is in that matrix, but behind it is those equations.

So what does elimination do? What's the first step of elimination? We accept the first equation, it's okay. I'm going to multiply that equation by the right number, the right multiplier, and I'm going to subtract it from the second equation. With what purpose? So that will decide what the multiplier should be. Our purpose is to knock out the x part of equation two. So our purpose is to reduce, to eliminate x.

So what do I multiply? And again, I'll do it with this matrix, because I can do it short. What's the multiplier here? What do I multiply? Equation one and subtract. Notice I'm saying that word subtract. I'd like to stick to that convention. I'll do a subtraction. So what, first of all, this is the key number, right? That I'm starting with. And that's called the pivot. I'll put a box around it and write its name down. That's the first pivot. The first pivot.

让我们来看一个方程组的例子。这里有三个方程和三个未知数。我们可以用一个 3x3 的矩阵来表示这个系统，即 Ax = b。这就是我们需要求解的系统，其中 A 是系统矩阵，x 是未知数向量，b 是等号右边的向量（2，12，2）。在描述消元法时，不断重复书写等号和加号等符号会变得十分繁琐。真正重要的是那个矩阵，它包含了所有的信息，而这些信息背后就是那些方程。

那么，消元法具体是如何操作的呢？消元法的第一步是什么？我们保留第一个方程不变，然后将它乘以一个适当的系数，并从第二个方程中减去。这个操作的目的是什么呢？这个目的决定了我们应该选择什么样的系数。我们的目标是消除第二个方程中的 x 项。换句话说，我们的目的是通过消元来简化方程。

那么，我们应该进行怎样的乘法运算呢？我将再次使用这个矩阵来演示，因为这样可以简洁地说明问题。这里的乘数是什么？我们需要乘以什么？我们要用第一个方程进行减法运算。请注意我使用了「减法」这个词，我想遵循这个惯例。那么，首先，我们要关注的是这个关键数字。这个数字被称为主元（pivot）。我会在它周围画一个框并标注它的名称。这是第一个主元。

OK, so I'm going to use that sort of like the key number in that equation. And now what's the multiplier? So I'm going to, my first row won't change, but I'm, that's the pivot row, but I'm going to use it, and now finally let me ask you what the multiplier is. Yes? Three. Three times that first equation will knock out that three. Okay, so what will it leave? So the multiplier is three. Three times that will leave, will make that zero. That was our purpose. Three twos away from the eight will leave a two, and three ones away from one will leave a minus two. And this guy didn't change.

Now the next step. This is forward elimination, and that step's completed. Oh well, you could say, wait a minute, what about the right hand side? The right hand side is like, gets carried along. Actually MATLAB finishes up with the left side before, and then just goes back to do the right side. Maybe I'll be MATLAB for a moment and do that. OK, so I just, like, I'm leaving a room for a column of B, the right-hand side, but I'll fill it in later.

好的，我们将把这个主元作为方程中的关键数字。现在让我们来确定乘数。第一行（也就是主元所在的行）不会改变，但我们会利用它来进行运算。那么，乘数是多少呢？答案是 3。我们用 3 乘以第一个方程，就可以消去第二行的那个 3。

让我们来看看具体的运算过程：

1. 乘数是 3。
2. 3 乘以第一行的元素，然后从第二行相应的元素中减去。
3. 3 乘以 1 等于 3，3 减去 3 得到 0，这就达到了我们的目的。
4. 3 乘以 2 等于 6，8 减去 6 得到 2。
5. 3 乘以 1 等于 3，1 减去 3 得到 -2。

最后一行保持不变。

通过这个过程，我们成功地将矩阵的第二行第一列的元素消为零，同时保持了第一行不变。这是高斯消元法的基本步骤之一。

现在我们进入下一步。这一步是前向消元（forward elimination），已经完成了。你可能会问，等等，右侧怎么办？右侧的处理其实是跟随左侧的操作一起进行的。实际上，MATLAB 会先完成左侧的计算，然后再回过头处理右侧。让我来模拟一下 MATLAB 的操作。我会在矩阵右侧留出一列的空间，用于放置 B（即方程组的右侧），但我们稍后再填充它。

OK, now the next step of elimination is what? Well, strictly speaking, I should, I cleaned up, this was the, this position that I cleaned up was like the two one position, row two, column one. So I got a zero in the two one position. I'll use two one as the index of that step. The next step should be to finish the column and get a zero in that position. So the next step is really the three one step, row three, column one. But of course, I already have zero. OK. So the multiplier is zero. I take zero of this equation away from this one, and I'm all set. So I won't repeat that, but there was a step there, which MATLAB would have to look. It would look at this number and do that step, unless you told it in advance that it was zero.

OK. Now what? Now we can see the second pivot, which is what? The second pivot, see, we've eliminated, x is now gone from this equation, right? We're down to two equations in y and z. And so now I just do it again, like everything's recursive at this, this is such a basic algorithm and you've seen it. But carry me through one last step. So this is still the first pivot. Now the second pivot is this guy, who has appeared there. And what's the multiplier, the appropriate multiplier now? And what's my purpose? Is to clean up, is to wipe out the three, two position. Right? This was the two, one step. And now I'm going to take the three, two step.

So this all stays the same. One, two, one, zero, two, minus one. And the pivots are there. Now I'm using this pivot. So what's the multiplier? Two. Two times this equation, this row, gets subtracted from this row and makes that a zero. So it's zero, zero, and what's, is it a five? Yeah, I guess it's a five, is that right? Because I have a one there, and I'm subtracting twice this, so I think it sits a five there. There's the third pivot. So let me put a box around all three pivots.

好，现在消元的下一步是什么呢？严格来说，我们刚才清理的是（2,1）位置，也就是第二行第一列。我们在这个位置得到了零。我们用（2,1）来标记这一步。下一步应该是完成这一列的消元，在下一个位置得到零。所以下一步实际上是处理（3,1）位置，即第三行第一列。但是，我们已经在那里有一个零了。这种情况下，消元的乘数就是零。我们用零乘以上面的方程，然后从当前方程中减去，结果就是不需要做任何改变。虽然我们不需要实际执行这一步，但 MATLAB 在运行时会检查这个位置的数值并执行相应的步骤，除非你提前告诉它那里已经是零了。

接下来我们该怎么做？现在我们可以看到第二个主元（pivot），它是什么呢？注意，第二个主元出现的同时，x 已经从这个方程中消失了，对吧？我们现在只剩下两个关于 y 和 z 的方程。所以现在我们只需重复之前的步骤，这个算法的核心就是这种递归性，你之前已经见过了。让我们一起完成最后一步。

第一个主元仍然保持不变。现在第二个主元已经出现在那里了。我们需要找出适当的乘数（multiplier）。我们的目的是什么？是要清理，具体来说是要消去第三行第二列的元素。之前我们完成了第二行第一列的消元，现在我们要进行第三行第二列的消元。

矩阵的前两行保持不变：1、2、1 和 0、2、-1。主元们都在那里。现在我们要使用第二个主元。那么乘数是多少？是 2。我们用第二行的两倍减去第三行，使第三行第二列的元素变为零。所以第三行变成了 0、0，还有最后一个元素，是 5 吗？是的，我想是 5。因为那里原本是 1，我们减去第二行的两倍，所以结果应该是 5。这就是第三个主元了。让我们把所有三个主元都用框标出来。

Is there a, I think that, oh, did I just invent a negative one? I'm sorry that the tape can't correct that as easily as I can. Okay, is that, thank you very much. You get an A in the course now. Is that correct? Is it correct now? OK. So the three pivots are there. I know right away a lot about this matrix. This elimination step from A, this matrix I'm going to call U. U for upper triangular. So the whole purpose of elimination was to get from A to U. And literally, that's the most common calculation in scientific computing. And people think of how could I do that faster, because it's a major, major thing. But we're doing it the straightforward way. We found three pivots. And by the way, I didn't say this, pivots can't be zero. I don't accept zero as a pivot. And I didn't get zero. So this matrix is great. It gave me three pivots. I didn't have to do anything special. I just followed the rules. And the pivots are one, two, and five. By the way, just because I always anticipate stuff from a later day, if I wanted to know the determinant of this matrix, which I never do want to know, but I would just multiply the pivots, the determinant is ten. So even things like the determinant are here.

通过这个过程，我们完成了高斯消元法的关键步骤，将原始矩阵转化为上三角矩阵。每一步我们都选择一个主元，然后用它来消去下方相应列的其他元素。这种方法不仅可以解线性方程组，还能帮助我们理解矩阵的结构和性质。

在讲解矩阵消元法时，我们可能会遇到一些小插曲。比如，我可能会不小心写出一个负数，但这种小错误很容易就能纠正过来。不过现在，我们已经找到了正确的三个主元（pivot），这真是太好了！

从这三个主元，我们可以立即了解到这个矩阵的很多信息。我们刚刚完成的消元步骤，是将原始矩阵 A 转换成了一个新的矩阵，我们称之为 U。这里的 U 代表上三角矩阵（upper triangular matrix），因为经过消元后，矩阵的非零元素都集中在对角线和其上方。

实际上，这个从 A 到 U 的转换过程是科学计算中最常见也最重要的操作之一。正因为它如此关键，研究人员一直在努力寻找更快的计算方法。不过今天，我们采用的是最直接的方法。

在这个过程中，我们成功找到了三个主元。需要特别指出的是，主元不能为零。幸运的是，在我们的例子中，所有的主元都不是零，分别是 1、2 和 5。这说明我们的矩阵状况良好，我们只需按部就班地进行消元，不需要采取任何特殊措施。

顺便提一下，虽然在实际应用中我们很少需要计算矩阵的行列式（determinant），但如果要计算的话，只需要将所有主元相乘即可。在这个例子中，行列式的值就是 1 × 2 × 5 = 10。这再次说明，通过消元法我们不仅可以将矩阵转化为上三角形式，还能得到诸如行列式这样的额外信息。

Okay, now, oh, let me talk about failure for a moment and then come back to success. How could this have failed? How could, well, how could, by fail I mean, fail to come up with three pivots? Tell me, I mean, there are a couple of points. I would have already been in trouble if this very first number here was zero. If it was a zero there, suppose that had been a zero. There were no x's in that first equation. Does that mean I can't solve the problem? Does that mean I quit? No. What do I do? I switch rows. I exchange rows. I exchange rows. So in case of a zero, I will not say zero pivot. I will never be heard to utter those words, zero pivot. But if there's a zero in the pivot position, maybe I can say that, I would try to exchange for a lower equation and get a proper pivot up there.

OK. Now, for example, this second pivot came out two. Could it have come out zero? Actually, if I changed that eight a little bit, I would have got, again, a little trouble. What should I change that eight to so that I run into trouble? A six. If that had been a six, then this would have been zero, and I couldn't have used that as the pivot, but I could have exchanged again. In this case, because when can I get out of trouble? I can get out of trouble if there's a non-zero below this troublesome zero. And there is here, so I would be OK in this case. If this was a six, I would survive by a row exchange.

让我们先来探讨一下在求解线性方程组时可能遇到的失败情况，然后再回到成功的解法。在这个过程中，我们可能会遇到哪些困难呢？特别是，在寻找三个主元（pivot）时可能会出现什么问题？

首先，如果在第一个方程中，我们遇到了一个零系数，会发生什么？这是否意味着我们无法解决这个问题？当然不是。在这种情况下，我们可以采用行交换的策略。也就是说，我们可以将这个方程与下面的方程交换位置，以获得一个非零的主元。这里需要强调的是，我们永远不会使用「零主元」这个术语，因为这在数学上是没有意义的。

让我们再看一个例子。假设在求解过程中，我们的第二个主元是 2。那么，有没有可能出现零呢？事实上，如果我们稍微改变一下原始方程中的某个系数，比如将 8 改为 6，我们就可能遇到麻烦。在这种情况下，计算结果会得到一个零，我们就不能用它作为主元了。

但是，即使在这种情况下，我们仍然有解决的办法。只要在这个麻烦的零下面存在一个非零数，我们就可以通过再次进行行交换来解决问题。这就是为什么在实际计算中，即使遇到了零，我们通常也能够继续求解的原因。

总的来说，在解线性方程组的过程中，遇到零并不意味着失败。通过灵活运用行交换这一策略，我们通常能够克服这些困难，继续我们的求解过程。

当然，在进行矩阵运算时，可能会出现无法处理某一行的情况，通常是因为该行下方出现了零，但在这个例子中并没有发生。不过，如果这里的数字 1 稍有不同，我们可能就会遇到麻烦。你们看，这个数字 1 最后变成了 5。那么，你们能想到如果这里是什么数字，会让我们陷入真正无法解决的困境吗？

所谓无法解决的困境，是指当主元（pivot）位置出现零，而我们又没有其他行可以交换时的情况。因此，一定存在某个特定的数字，如果出现在这个位置，就意味着运算失败。

答案是负四，很好！假设这个位置是负四，我们暂且把它放在这里。如果是负四，我们会经历相同的运算步骤。这个数字一直会保持为负四，但在最后一步，它会变成零。这样我们就无法得到第三个主元，导致矩阵不可逆（not invertible）。虽然矩阵的逆运算将在下周详细讲解，但你们应该已经听说过这些概念。



Now, of course, it might have happened that I couldn't do the row, that there was zeros below it, but here there wasn't. Now, I could also have got in trouble if this number one was a little different. See, that one became a five, I guess, by the end. a five, I guess, by the end. So do you, can you see what number there would have got me trouble that I really couldn't get out of? Trouble that I couldn't get out of would mean if the pivot is, oh, if zero is in the pivot position and I can't, I've got no place to exchange. So there must be some number, which if I had had here, it would have meant failure. Negative four, good. If it was a negative four here, if it happened to be a negative four, I'll temporarily put it up here. If this had been a negative four z, then I would have gone through the same steps. This would have been a minus four. It still would have been a minus four. But at the last minute, it would have become zero. And there wouldn't have been a third pivot. The matrix would have not been invertible. Of course, the inverse of a matrix is coming next week, but you've heard these words before. So that's how we identify failure. There's temporary failure when we can do a row exchange and get out of it, or there's complete failure when we get a zero and there's nothing below that we can use.

Okay, let's stay with back to success now. In fact, I guess the next topic is back substitution. So what's back substitution? Well, now I better bring the right-hand side in. So what would MATLAB do, and what should we do? Let me bring in the right-hand side as an extra column. So there comes b. So it's. This is, I would call this the augmented matrix. Augment means you've tacked something on. I've tacked on this extra column. Because when I'm working with equations, I do the same thing to both sides. So at this step, I subtracted two of the first equation away from the second equation so that this augmented shall I even brought some colored chalk, but I don't know if it shows up. So this is like the augmented. No, Pam, circle the wrong thing. OK, here is b. OK, that's the extra column.

OK, so what happened to that extra column, the right-hand side of the equations, when I did the first step? So that was three of this away from this, so it took, the two stayed the same, but three twos got taken away from twelve, leaving six, and that two stayed the same. So this is the, how it's looking halfway along. And let me just carry to the end. The two and the six stay the same, but what do I have here? Oh gosh. Help me out now. So now I'm, this is still like forward elimination. I got to this point, which I think is right. And now what did I do at this step? I multiplied that pivot by two, or that whole equation by two, and subtracted from that. So I think I take two sixes, which is 12 away from the two. Do you think minus 10 is my final right-hand side, the right-hand side that goes with u? And let me call that once and forever the vector c. So c is what happens to b, and u is what happens to a. OK. There you've seen elimination clean.

OK. Oh, what's back substitution? So what are my final equations then? Can I copy these equations? x plus 2y plus z equals two is still there, and two y minus two z equals six is there, and five z is minus ten. OK. Those are the equations that these numbers are telling me about. Those are the equations u x equals c. OK, how do I solve them? What one do I solve for first? z. I see immediately that the correct value of z is negative two, and what do I do next? I go back upwards, I now know z here, so if z is negative two, that's four there, is that right? And so two y plus the four is six, maybe y is one. This is back substitution, we're doing it on the fly because it's so easy. And then x is, so x two y's is two minus two, maybe x is two. So you see what back substitution is. It's the simple step solving the equations in reverse order because the system is triangular. OK. Good. So that's elimination and back substitution, and I kept the right-hand side along.

OK, now what do I, what, so that, that's like his first piece of the lecture. What's the second piece? Matrices are going to get in. So I first, I wrote stuff with x, y's and z's in there. Then I really got the right shorthand, just writing the matrix entries. And now I want to write shorthand, just writing the matrix entries. And now I want to write the operations that I did in matrices, right? I've carried the matrices along, but I haven't said the operation the, the, the, those, those elimination steps I, I now want to express as matrices.

OK, here they come. So now this is elimination matrices. OK, let me take that first step, which took me from 1, two, one, three, eight, one, O four, one. I want to operate on that. I want to do elimination on that. OK. OK, now actually I'm remembering a point I want to single out as especially important. Let me move the board up for that. Because when we do matrix operations, we've got to, like, be able to see the big picture.

OK, last time I spoke about the big picture of when I multiply a matrix by a right-hand side. If I have some matrix there and I multiply it by three, four, five, let's say, so here's a matrix. What did I say? Well, I guess I only said it on the videotape, but do you remember how I look at that matrix multiplication? The result of multiplying a matrix by some vector is a combination of the columns of the matrix. It's three times the first column. It's three times column one, plus four times column two, plus five times column three. OK. I'm going to come back to that multiple times.

What I wanted to do now was to emphasize the parallel thing with rows. Why? Because all our operations here for this, like this two weeks of the course, are row operations. So I have to, so this isn't what I need for row operations. Let me do a row operation. Suppose I have my matrix, again, and suppose I multiply on the left by some, let's say, one, two, seven. multiply on the left by some, let's say, one, two, seven. Again, I'm just like saying what the result is. And then we'll say how matrix multiplication works, and we'll see that it's true. OK. But maybe already I'm making, I'm sort of bringing up the central idea of linear algebra, is how these matrices work by rows as well as by columns.

OK, how does it work by rows? So this is a, that's a row vector, I could say that's a one by three matrix, a row vector multiplying a three by three matrix. What's the output? What's the product of a row times a matrix? And, OK, it's a row. A matrix times a column is a column. So matrix times a column is a column. And we know what column it is. Over here, I'm doing a row times a matrix, and what's the answer? It's one of that first row, so it's one times row one, plus two times row two, plus seven times row three. plus seven times row three. As we do matrix multiplication, keep your eye on what it's doing with whole vectors. And what it's doing in this case is it's combining the rows. We have a combination, a linear combination of the rows.

OK, I want to use that. OK, so my question is, what's the matrix that does this first step? That subtracts three of equation one from equation two. That's what I want to do. So this is going to be a matrix that's going to subtract three times row one from row two. And leaves the other rows the same. Just, I mean, the answer is going to be that. So whatever matrix this is, and you're going to, like, tell me what matrix will do it, it's the matrix that leaves the first row unchanged, leaves the last row unchanged, but takes three of these away from this, so it puts a zero there, a two there, and a minus two. Good. What matrix will do it? It's these. It should be a pretty simple matrix, because we're doing a very simple step. We're just doing this step that changes row two.

So actually row one is not changing. So tell me how the matrix should begin. One, so the first row of the matrix will be one, zero, zero. Because that's just the right thing that takes one of that row and none of the other rows, and that's what we want. What's the last row of the matrix? Zero, zero, one. Because that takes one of the third row and none of the other rows, that's great. OK. Now suppose I didn't want to do anything at all. Suppose my row, well, I guess maybe I had a case here when I already had a zero and didn't have to do anything. What matrix does nothing? Like, just leaves you where you were?

If I put in zero, one, zero, that would be, that's the matrix, what's the name of that matrix? The identity matrix, right. So it does absolutely nothing, it just multiplies everything and leaves it where it is. It's like a one, like the number one for matrices. But that's not what we want, because we want to change this row two. So what's the correct? What should I put in here now to come out to do it right? I want to get, what do I want, what am I after? I want to subtract my, I want three of row one to get subtracted off. So what's that row, what's the right matrix, finish that matrix for me. Negative three goes here, and what goes here? That one, and what goes here? The zero.

That's the good matrix. That's the matrix that takes minus three of row one, plus the row two, and gives the new row two. Should we just, like, check some particular entry? How do I check a particular entry of a matrix, in matrix multiplication? Like, suppose I wanted to check the entry here that's in row two, column three. So where does the entry in row two, column three come from? I would look at row two of this guy and column three of this one to get that number. That number comes from the second row and the third column, and I just take this dot product, minus three, I'm multiplying minus three plus one and zero gives the minus two. Yeah, it works.

So we've got various ways to multiply matrices now. We're sort of like informally. We've got by columns, we've got, well, we will have by columns, by rows, by each entry at a time. But it's good to see that matrix multiplication when one of the matrices is so simple. So this guy is our elementary matrix. Let's call it E for elementary or elimination. And let me put the indexes two, one, because it's the matrix that we needed to fix the two, one position. It's the matrix that we needed to get this two one position to be zero. OK. Good enough.

So what do I do next? I need another matrix, right? I need to, there's another step here, and I want to express the whole elimination process in matrix language. So tell me what now, so next step, step two, which was what? Subtract, what was the actual step that we did? I think I subtracted, do you remember? I had a two in the pivot and a four below it, so I subtracted two times row two from row three. From row three. Tell me the matrix that'll do that. And tell me its name.

Okay, it's going to be e for elementary or elimination matrix, and what's the index number that I used to tell me what e three two, right? Because it's fixing this three two position. And what is the matrix now? OK, you remember, so E three two is supposed to multiply my guy that I have, and it's supposed to produce the right result, which was it's supposed to leave the first row, it's supposed to leave the first row, it's supposed to leave the second row, and it's supposed to straighten out the third row to this. And what's the matrix that does that?

One zero zero, right? Because we don't change the first row. And the next row we don't change either. And the last row is the one we do change. And what do I do? Let's see, I subtract two times, so what's this row? What's this here? Zero, right? Because the first row is not involved. It's just in the three two position, isn't it? The key number is this minus the multiplier that goes sitting there in that three two position. So is it a minus two to subtract two, and then this is a one, so that the overall effect is to take minus two of this row, plus one of that.

OK. So I've now given you the pieces. The elimination matrices, the elementary matrices that take each step. So now what? Now the next point in the lecture is to put those steps together into a matrix that does it all. And see how it all happens. So now I'm going to express the whole, everything we did today, so far, on A, was to start with A, we multiplied it by E21, that was the first step, and then we multiplied that result by E32, and that led us to this thing, and what was that matrix? U.

You see why I like matrix notation, because there in like little space, a few bits when it's compressed on the web, is everything, is this whole lecture. OK. Now, there are important facts about matrix multiplication. And we're close to maybe the most important. And that is this. Suppose I ask you this question. Suppose I start with a matrix A, and I want to end with a matrix U, and I want to say, what matrix does the whole job? What matrix takes me from A to U, using the letters I've got. So, and the answer is simple. I'm not asking this is, but it's highly important. How would I create the matrix that does the whole job at once, that does all of elimination in one shot?

It would be, I would just put these together, right? In other words, this is the thing I'm struggling to say. I can move those parentheses. If I keep the matrices in order, I can't mess around with the order of the matrices, but I can change the order that I do the multiplications. I can multiply these two first. In other words, you see what those parentheses are doing? It's saying multiply the e's first, and that gives you the matrix that does everything at once.

OK. So this fact, that this is automatically the same as this, for every matrix multiplication, which I'm conscious of still not telling you in every detail, but like you're seeing how it works. And this is highly important, and maybe tell me the long word that describes this law for matrices, that you can move the parentheses. It's called the associative law. I think you can now forget that. But don't forget the law. I mean, like forget the word associative. I don't know. But don't forget the law. Because actually, we'll see so many steps in linear algebra, so many proofs even of main facts, come from just moving the parentheses. And it's not that easy to prove that this is correct. You have to go into the gory details of matrix multiplication, do it both ways, and see that you come out the same. Maybe I'll leave the author to do that.

OK. So there we go. That's how I, so there's a single matrix, I could call it E. Now, oh, while we're talking about these matrices, tell me one other, there's another type of elementary matrix, and we already said why we might need it. We didn't need it in this case, but it's the matrix that exchanges two rows. It's called a permutation matrix. Can you just, like, tell me what that would be? So I'm just like this is a slight digression. And we'll, yeah, so let me get some, let me figure out where I'm going to put a permutation matrix. You'll see I'm always squeezing stuff in.

So permutation, or in fact, this one will like exchange rows. So I exchange rows one and two just to make life easy. So if I had my matrix, let me just do two by two, A, B, C, D. Suppose I want to find the matrix that exchanges those rows. What is it? So the matrix that exchanges those rows, the row I want is C, D, and it's there. So I better take one of it. And the row I want is cd and it's there, so I better take one of it. The row I want here is up top, so I'll take one of that. So actually, I've just, the easy way, this is my matrix that I'll call p for permutation. It's the matrix, actually the easy way to find it is just do the thing to the identity matrix, exchange the rows of the identity matrix, and then that's the matrix that'll do row exchanges for you.

Suppose I wanted to exchange columns instead. Columns have hardly got into today's lecture, but they certainly are going to be around. How could I, if I started with this matrix A, B, C, D, then I wouldn't, I'm not even going to write this down, I'm just going to ask you. Because in elimination, we're doing rows. But suppose we wanted to exchange the columns of a matrix. How would I do that? What matrix multiplication would do that job?

Actually, why not? I'll write it down. So this is like just, I'll write it under here and then hide it again. OK. Suppose I had my matrix ABCD and I want to get to AC over here and BD here. What matrix does that job? Can I multiply, can I cook up some matrix that produces that answer? And you can see from where I put my hand, I was really asking, can I put a matrix here on the left that will exchange columns? And the answer is no.

So I'm just bringing out again this point that when I multiply on the left, I'm doing row operations. So if I want to do a column operation, where do I put that permutation matrix? On the right. If I put it here, where I just barely left room for it, so I'll exchange the two columns of the identity. Then it comes out right. Because now I'm multiplying a column at a time. This is the first column and says take one, take none of that column, one of this one, and then you got it. Over here, take one of this one, none of this one, and you've got AC.

So in short, to do column operations, the matrix multiplies on the right. To do row operations, it multiplies on the left. OK. OK. And it's row operations that we're really doing. OK. And of course, I mentioned in passing, but I better say it very clearly, that you can't exchange the orders of matrices, and that's just the point I was making again here. A times B is not the same as B times A. You have to keep these matrices in their Gauss-given order here, right? But you can move the parentheses. So that, in other words, the commutative law, which would allow you to take it in the other order, is false. So we have to keep it in that order.

OK. So what next? I could do this multiplication. I could do E3 2, so let me come back to see what that was. Here was E21. And here is E32. And if I multiply those matrices together, E32 and then E21, I'll get a single matrix that does elimination. and then e2,1, I'll get a single matrix that does elimination. I don't want to do it then. If I do that multiplication, there's a better way to do this. And so in this last few minutes of today's lecture, can I anticipate that better way?

The better way is to think not how do I get from A to U, but how do I get from U back to A? So reversing steps is going to come in. Inverse, I'll use the word inverse here. OK, so let me make the first step at what's the inverse matrix. All the matrices you've seen on this board have inverses. I didn't write any bad matrices down. We spoke about possible failure, and for a moment we put in a matrix that would fail. But right now all these matrices are good, they're all invertible, and let's take the inverse, well let me say first what does the inverse mean and find it.

OK, so we're getting a little leg up on inverses. OK, so this is the final moments of today. Ah, sorry, he's still there. OK. Inverses. OK, and I'm just going to take one example and then we're done. The example I'll take will be that E. So my matrix is 1 0 0 minus 3, minus 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1. And I want to find the matrix that undoes that step. So what was that step? The step was subtract 3 times row one from row two. So what matrix will get me back? What matrix will bring back, you know, if I started with a two, twelve, two, and it changed it to a two, six, two because of this guy, I want to get back to the two, twelve, two. I want to find the matrix which undoes elimination, the matrix which multiplies this to give the identity.

And you can tell me what I should do in words first, and then we'll write down the matrix that does it. If this step subtracted three times row one from row two, what's the inverse step? I add three times row one to row two, right? I add it back. What I subtracted away, I add back. So the inverse matrix in this case is, I now want to add three times row one to row two. So I won't change row one, I won't change row three, and I'll add three times row one to row two. That's a case where the inverse is clear. It's clear in words what to do. Because what this did was simple to express. It just changed row two by subtracting three of row one. So to invert it, I go that way.

And if we do that calculation, three times this row plus one times this row comes out the right row of the identity. OK, so inverses are, so if this matrix was e, and this matrix is i for identity, then what's the notation for this guy? e to the minus one, e inverse.

OK. Let's stop there for today. That's a little jump on what's coming on Monday. So see you Monday. So, see you Monday.

这就是我们识别矩阵运算失败的方法。失败可以分为两种：暂时的失败和完全的失败。暂时的失败是指我们可以通过行交换来解决问题；而完全的失败则是指当我们得到一个零，而下面没有可用的非零元素来替换它时的情况。

好的，让我们回到之前的话题。实际上，我猜下一个主题是回代法（back substitution）。那么什么是回代法呢？现在，我们最好把等式右边也考虑进来。让我们思考一下 MATLAB 会如何处理，以及我们应该如何操作。

我会把右边作为一个额外的列加入到我们的矩阵中。这就是 b 向量。这样得到的矩阵，我们称之为增广矩阵（augmented matrix）。"增广」的意思是我们在原矩阵上添加了一些东西，在这里就是添加了这个额外的列。

我们这样做是因为在处理方程时，我们对等式的两边进行相同的操作。例如，在这一步中，我从第二个方程中减去了第一个方程的两倍，这个操作也要应用到增广的部分。

（这里讲者提到了彩色粉笔，但这可能只是现场授课时的即兴发挥，与主要内容无关。）

总之，我们现在有了这个增广矩阵。这里的 b 就是我们添加的额外列，它代表了方程组的右边部分。

和调整。
2. 缺少对专业术语的解释，如「前向消元」、「主元」等。
3. 数学符号和计算过程的描述不够清晰，需要更好地组织。
4. 缺少对整个过程的总体概述，使读者难以理解作者在解释什么。
5. 一些口语化的表达（如「哦天哪"）需要调整为更正式的表述。

***

好的，让我们来谈谈回代法（back substitution）。那么，我们最终得到的方程组是什么呢？让我们看看这些方程：x + 2y + z = 2 仍然存在，2y - 2z = 6 也在那里，还有 5z = -10。这些就是这些数字所代表的方程组，也就是我们通常表示为 Ux = c 的方程组。

那么，我们该如何解这个方程组呢？我们应该先解哪个未知数？答案是 z。我们可以立即看出 z 的正确值是 -2。接下来怎么办？我们向上回溯。既然我们知道了 z = -2，那么在第二个方程中，-2z 就等于 4，对吗？所以 2y + 4 = 6，因此 y = 1。这就是回代法的过程，我们可以很容易地即时进行计算。

最后，我们来求解 x。在第一个方程中，2y = 2，所以 x + 2 - 2 = 2，因此 x = 2。

这就是回代法的全过程。它是一种以相反顺序解方程的简单方法，之所以可行是因为我们的方程组现在是上三角形的。

很好，我们已经完成了消元和回代的过程。在整个过程中，我们都保留了方程组的右侧（即等号右边的常数项）。这种方法使我们能够同时处理多个右侧常数，非常方便。

好的，我们刚刚讲完了讲座的第一部分。那么第二部分是什么呢？我们将要引入矩阵的概念。我最初使用 x、y 和 z 来表示变量，然后我们学会了用更简洁的方式，只写矩阵的元素。现在，我想用矩阵来表示我们之前进行的运算。虽然我们一直在使用矩阵，但我还没有用矩阵来表示那些消元步骤。现在，我想用矩阵来表达这些步骤。

接下来，我们将介绍消元矩阵（elimination matrices）。让我们回顾第一步，我们从矩阵
[1 2 1]
[3 8 1]
[0 4 1]
开始。我想对这个矩阵进行操作，也就是进行消元。

在继续之前，我想强调一个特别重要的点。为了更好地理解这个概念，我们需要看到更大的图景。因为在进行矩阵运算时，我们必须能够把握整体情况。

好的，上次我讲解了矩阵与右侧向量相乘的整体概念。假设我们有一个矩阵，将它乘以一个向量，比如 [3，4，5]。我在视频中解释过，但你们还记得我是如何理解这个矩阵乘法的吗？将矩阵乘以向量的结果可以看作是矩阵各列的线性组合。具体来说，它等于第一列的 3 倍，加上第二列的 4 倍，再加上第三列的 5 倍。这个概念我们稍后还会多次提到。

现在，我想强调一下与行相关的类似概念。为什么要这样做呢？因为在接下来的两周课程中，我们将主要关注行操作。所以，我们需要从行的角度来理解矩阵运算。让我们来看一个行操作的例子。假设我们还是有一个矩阵，这次我们从左边乘以一个向量，比如 [1，2，7]。同样，我们先给出结果，然后再解释矩阵乘法是如何工作的，以及为什么这个结果是正确的。实际上，我正在引入线性代数的一个核心思想，那就是矩阵可以通过行和列两种方式来理解和操作。

让我们来看看矩阵乘法是如何按行进行运算的。假设我们有一个行向量，它可以被视为一个 1x3 的矩阵，现在我们要将它乘以一个 3x3 的矩阵。那么，这个乘法的结果会是什么呢？更一般地说，一个行向量乘以一个矩阵的乘积是什么？

首先，我们要明白，这个乘积仍然是一个行向量。这与矩阵乘以列向量得到列向量的情况类似。在矩阵乘以列向量的情况下，我们可以很容易地确定结果是哪一列。

现在，让我们回到行向量乘以矩阵的情况。假设我们的行向量是 [1 2 7]，那么结果将是如何计算的呢？实际上，它是将这个行向量的元素与矩阵的行进行线性组合。具体来说，结果将是：1 乘以矩阵的第一行，加上 2 乘以矩阵的第二行，再加上 7 乘以矩阵的第三行。

在进行矩阵乘法时，重要的是要关注它对整个向量的操作。在这个例子中，我们可以看到，它实际上是在对矩阵的行进行组合。这种组合方式被称为行的线性组合。

通过这种方式理解矩阵乘法，我们可以更好地把握其本质，即向量之间的线性组合操作。

好的，让我们来讨论这个问题。我们要找的是一个可以执行第一步操作的矩阵（matrix）。这个操作是从方程二中减去三倍的方程一。换句话说，我们需要一个矩阵，它能从第二行减去三倍的第一行，同时保持其他行不变。

让我们具体看看这个操作会产生什么结果。它会在第二行的第一个位置放一个零，第二个位置放一个二，第三个位置放一个负二。那么，什么样的矩阵能完成这个任务呢？

这应该是一个相当简单的矩阵，因为我们只是在做一个简单的步骤：改变第二行。

让我们从矩阵的第一行开始。第一行应该是 [1，0，0]，因为这正好能保持原矩阵的第一行不变，这正是我们想要的。

那么最后一行呢？应该是 [0，0，1]。这样可以保持原矩阵的第三行不变，这也正是我们需要的。

现在，假设我们遇到一种情况，其中第二行的第一个元素已经是零，我们不需要做任何操作。那么，什么样的矩阵可以让一切保持原样，不做任何改变呢？

时进行精简。

***

现在我们已经掌握了多种矩阵相乘的方法。虽然我们目前还是在非正式地探讨这个话题，但我们已经了解了按列相乘的方法，接下来还会学习按行相乘和逐元素相乘的方法。不过，当其中一个矩阵非常简单时，观察矩阵乘法的结果是很有启发性的。这里我们有一个基本矩阵，让我们称它为 E，代表基本矩阵（elementary matrix）或消元矩阵（elimination matrix）。我们给它标上索引（2,1），因为它是我们用来处理（2,1）位置的矩阵，目的是将这个位置的元素变为零。

接下来，我们需要引入另一个矩阵来继续我们的消元过程。我希望能用矩阵语言来表达整个消元过程。那么，第二步是什么呢？让我们回顾一下：我们在主元位置有一个 2，下面有一个 4。我们的操作是从第三行减去两倍的第二行。现在，请告诉我一个能够实现这一操作的矩阵，以及它的名称。

让我们来讨论基本矩阵（elementary matrix）或消元矩阵（elimination matrix），用字母 e 表示。我们使用的索引号，比如 e32，是用来表示这个矩阵要修正的位置，在这个例子中是第 3 行第 2 列的位置。现在，我们来看看这个矩阵是什么样的。

记住，E32 矩阵的作用是乘以我们原有的矩阵，产生正确的结果。它应该保持第一行和第二行不变，而将第三行调整成我们需要的形式。那么，实现这一操作的矩阵是什么呢？

这个矩阵的第一行是 [1 0 0]，因为我们不改变第一行。第二行也保持不变。关键在于第三行，这是我们需要改变的地方。让我们仔细看看：我们需要减去第二行的两倍。那么，第三行的第一个元素是什么？是 0，对吧？因为第一列不参与运算。真正的关键数字位于第 3 行第 2 列的位置，也就是 -2。这个 -2 就是我们用来减去第二行两倍的乘数。最后，第三列的 1 确保了我们保留了原矩阵第三行的信息。

因此，这个基本矩阵 E32 的效果是：取原矩阵第二行的 -2 倍，加上原矩阵的第三行，从而得到新矩阵的第三行。这就是矩阵消元过程中的一个关键步骤。

好的，现在我已经给你介绍了各个组成部分：消元矩阵（elimination matrices）和完成每一步的初等矩阵（elementary matrices）。那么接下来呢？讲座的下一个重点是将这些步骤组合成一个可以完成所有操作的矩阵，并观察整个过程是如何发生的。现在，让我们来总结一下我们今天到目前为止对矩阵 A 所做的所有操作：我们从 A 开始，首先将其乘以 E21，这是第一步；然后我们将得到的结果乘以 E32，最终得到了一个新的矩阵。这个新矩阵是什么？它就是 U。

这就是为什么我喜欢使用矩阵表示法的原因。因为它能够在很小的空间内，甚至在网络上压缩后只需几个比特，就包含了整个讲座的所有信息。现在，关于矩阵乘法有一些重要的性质，我们即将讨论可能是最重要的一个。假设我问你这样一个问题：如果我从矩阵 A 开始，想最终得到矩阵 U，那么什么矩阵可以完成这整个过程？换句话说，使用我们已有的符号，什么矩阵可以将 A 转换为 U？答案其实很简单。我现在不是在问这个答案是什么，但这个问题非常重要。我们如何创建一个矩阵，使它能够一次性完成整个工作，一步到位地完成所有的消元运算？

在矩阵乘法中，我们可以改变乘法的顺序，只要保持矩阵的排列顺序不变。换句话说，我们可以移动括号的位置。例如，我们可以先将两个矩阵相乘，然后再与第三个矩阵相乘。这就像括号在说："先乘以这些矩阵，得到的结果就是一个可以一次性完成所有操作的矩阵。"

这个性质对于每个矩阵乘法都成立，虽然我没有详细解释每个细节，但你可以看到它是如何工作的。这个性质非常重要，它有一个专业术语来描述：结合律（associative law）。虽然你可以忘记这个术语，但请不要忘记这个法则本身。因为在线性代数（linear algebra）中，我们会看到许多步骤和主要定理的证明都依赖于移动括号这个简单操作。

然而，证明这个法则并不像看起来那么简单。你需要深入研究矩阵乘法的细节，用两种不同的方式进行计算，然后验证结果是否相同。这个证明过程可能需要更详细的解释，也许我们可以让教科书的作者来完成这个任务。

好的，让我们来总结一下。我们刚刚讨论的是一个单一的矩阵，我们可以将其称为 E（代表基本矩阵）。现在，在讨论这些矩阵的过程中，我想提到另一种类型的基本矩阵，我们之前提到过可能会需要它。虽然在这个例子中我们没有用到，但它是用来交换两行的矩阵，称为置换矩阵（Permutation Matrix）。让我稍微解释一下它是什么。这是一个小小的题外话，但我觉得很有必要提一下。我会找个合适的地方把置换矩阵的内容插入进来。你会发现我总是在尽可能地压缩内容以包含更多信息。

置换矩阵的作用是交换行。为了简化说明，让我们以交换第一行和第二行为例。假设我们有一个 2x2 的矩阵，记为：

```
A B
C D
```我们想找到一个矩阵，能够交换这些行。这个矩阵是什么呢？交换行后，我们希望得到：```
C D
A B
```所以，我们需要一个矩阵，它能够将原矩阵的第二行移到第一行的位置，将第一行移到第二行的位置。这个矩阵就是：```
0 1
1 0
```

我们称这个矩阵为 P，代表置换（Permutation）。实际上，找到这个矩阵的简单方法是对单位矩阵进行相同的行交换操作。换句话说，如果你交换单位矩阵的行，得到的结果就是能为你执行行交换的置换矩阵。

假设我们想要交换矩阵的列，而不是行。虽然今天的讲座几乎没有提到列的操作，但这确实是一个值得讨论的问题。让我们思考一下，如果我们有一个矩阵 A、B、C、D，我们该如何交换它的列？什么样的矩阵乘法可以完成这个任务？

为了更好地说明这个问题，我们不妨把它写下来。假设我们有一个矩阵 ABCD，我们想把它变成 AC 在左边，BD 在右边。有没有某个矩阵可以通过乘法来实现这个结果呢？更具体地说，我们能不能在原矩阵的左边乘以某个矩阵来交换列？

答案是不能。这再次强调了一个重要的点：当我们在矩阵左边进行乘法时，我们实际上是在进行行操作。那么，如果我们想进行列操作，应该把置换矩阵放在哪里呢？答案是右边。

如果我们在原矩阵的右边放置一个矩阵，比如说交换了单位矩阵的两列，那么结果就会是正确的。这是因为这样我们就是一次处理一列。对于第一列，我们取原矩阵的第一列的全部，不取第二列的任何部分，这样就得到了新矩阵的第一列。同样，对于第二列，我们取原矩阵第二列的全部，不取第一列的任何部分，这样就得到了新矩阵的第二列，也就是 AC。

简单来说，当我们进行列操作时，矩阵在等式右侧相乘；而进行行操作时，矩阵则在左侧相乘。需要注意的是，我们实际上主要关注的是行操作。

这里有一点非常重要，我之前只是顺带提到，现在我要明确强调：矩阵乘法的顺序是不能随意交换的。也就是说，矩阵 A 乘以矩阵 B 的结果通常与矩阵 B 乘以矩阵 A 的结果是不同的。我们必须严格按照特定的顺序进行矩阵乘法，就像高斯消元法中规定的那样。虽然我们可以调整括号的位置，但不能改变矩阵相乘的顺序。换句话说，在矩阵乘法中，我们熟悉的交换律（即 a × b = b × a）是不适用的。

接下来，我们可以继续进行矩阵乘法。让我们回顾一下之前的操作，这里有 E21 和 E32 两个矩阵。如果我们将这两个矩阵相乘，即 E32 乘以 E21，我们就能得到一个可以直接进行消元的单一矩阵。但是，直接进行这样的乘法可能并不是最优选择。在今天讲座的最后几分钟，我想向大家介绍一个更好的方法来处理这个问题。

更好的思考方式不是考虑如何从 A 到达 U，而是思考如何从 U 返回 A。这就涉及到了逆向步骤。在这里，我们要引入「逆」这个概念。让我们先来探讨一下什么是逆矩阵。

值得注意的是，我在黑板上写下的所有矩阵都是可逆的。我没有列出任何不可逆的矩阵（也称为奇异矩阵）。虽然我们之前讨论过可能出现的失败情况，甚至一度引入了一个不可逆的矩阵作为例子，但现在黑板上的所有矩阵都是好的，都是可逆的。让我们来看看如何求逆，以及逆矩阵的含义。

好的，我们已经对逆矩阵有了初步的了解。现在让我们进入今天的最后部分：逆矩阵。

我们来看一个具体的例子，就用之前提到的矩阵 E。这个矩阵 E 是：

```
| 1 0 0 |
|-3 1 0 |
| 0 0 1 |
```

我们的目标是找到一个矩阵，能够撤销这个矩阵 E 所做的变换。那么，E 做了什么变换呢？它的作用是将第二行减去 3 倍的第一行。

现在，我们要找到一个矩阵，能够将这个变换逆转回去。换句话说，如果我们最初有一个向量（2，12，2），经过 E 的变换后变成了（2，6，2），我们需要找到一个矩阵，能够将（2，6，2）变回（2，12，2）。

我们要找的是一个矩阵，它能够撤销消元过程，也就是说，当它乘以 E 时，结果应该是单位矩阵。这个矩阵就是 E 的逆矩阵。

让我先用通俗的语言解释一下我们要做什么，然后我们再用矩阵形式表示出来。假设我们之前的操作是从第二行减去三倍的第一行，那么它的逆操作是什么呢？没错，就是将三倍的第一行加回到第二行。我们要把之前减去的内容加回来。因此，在这种情况下，逆矩阵的操作就是将三倍的第一行加到第二行。具体来说，我们不改变第一行和第三行，只将三倍的第一行加到第二行。这是一个逆矩阵很容易理解的例子。用语言描述要做什么非常清晰，因为原始操作很容易表达 —— 它只是通过减去三倍的第一行来改变第二行。所以要逆转这个操作，我们只需反向进行。

如果我们进行计算，将三倍第一行加上原来的第二行，得到的结果正好是单位矩阵（identity matrix）对应的行。那么，如果我们用 e 表示原始矩阵，用 i 表示单位矩阵，那么这个逆矩阵应该如何表示呢？答案是 e^(-1），即 e 的逆。

好的，今天我们就讲到这里。这其实是对下周一课程内容的一个小小预告。我们下周一见。
